<h2>5 Steps to Sanity This Summer</h2>
<p>As much as I love the summer break I also stress thinking about &ldquo;What am I going to do with my kids this summer?&rdquo;&rdquo; How am I going to keep them busy and not zoning in front of TV or computer?&rdquo; &ldquo;When am I going to get things done?&rdquo; Instead of dreading summer, use these ideas for making this a great summer for you and your children!</p>
<h4>1. Hold a Family Meeting</h4>
<p>Let everyone share their views on what will make the summer a success. Make a list of chores and divide up responsibility among all family members so every feels like they are contributing and a valued member of the team. Children can contribute more in the summer since they don&rsquo;t have homework.</p>
<h4>2. Agree on Rules</h4>
<p>Family meetings are a good time to decide upon summer rules for &ldquo;screen time,&rdquo; reading, activities, play dates and more. Ask the kids what they think is reasonable and negotiate from there. One summer my 9 year old son volunteered the rule for 2 hours of screen time a day and you could earn more screen time for every hour you read. Since this was his idea, it was much easier to get his cooperation to comply all summer long and I was thrilled.</p>
<h4>3. Explore Your Options</h4>
<p>Look into what is available for your child in your community this summer and what would be fun for you?</p>
<ul class="list_002">
<li>Check out the Parks &amp; Recreation Centers for mini camps, outings, and sports.</li>
<li>Explore community water parks in your area and visit a different one each week. My favorites are in Littleton and Golden.</li>
<li>Google &ldquo;free factory tours&rdquo; and plan outings. My favorites are Hammond Candy and Celestial Seasonings.</li>
<li>Join multiple library systems summer reading programs and local bookstores. If your kids finish one program they can work on the next to keep them motivated to read all summer long.</li>
<li>Go on a hike! I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Jefferson County Open Spaces for kid friendly hikes within 30-45 minute drive. My favorite is Lair 0&rsquo;Bear for a stream to play in, easy hike, and great picnic spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Structure Your Routine</h4>
<p>Decide what your family&rsquo;s general daily routine will be with set bedtimes, TV times, outdoor times, mealtimes, quiet times, whatever works for you. Routines can make a big difference in your child&rsquo;s behavior and your sanity.</p>
<h4>5. Make Time for Yourself</h4>
<p>Taking care of yourself and your marriage is vital if you are to have the resources for coping with the constant demands and stress of parenting.</p>
<ul class="list_002">
<li>Get up early and let your kids sleep late to find some quiet time.</li>
<li>Trade with another parent to watch kids so you can run errands.</li>
<li>Plan parent-child date so one parent take the children out every week giving the other parent a chance to relax with the house all to themselves.</li>
<li>Plan date night each week for you and your spouse to go out together without the children or for the children to go elsewhere while you two stay at home alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy your summer!</p></div>

<h2>Guest Article 31 Days of Prayer - The True Value of Volunteering with Children and Youth</h2><div id="sermon-info" class="sermon"><ul class="sermon-buttons"></ul><!-- .sermon-buttons --><p class="sermon-meta">Posted Oct 19th, 2012 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Series: 31 Day Prayer Guide </p></div><!-- .sermon --><div id="text"><blockquote>During our 31 Days of Prayer focus, we are posting a few guest articles to give perspective to certain prayer focuses. Today we are focusing on praying for our sunday school teachers and youth workers. Our guest writer Patti Jensen, mother of two, real estate agent, wife, and writer gives us some insight into how children's ministry has impacted her family and how she has impacted others through both youth and children's ministry.</blockquote><h4>My four year old daughter Emersyn absolutely loves the children&rsquo;s ministry at Portland Christian Center.</h4><p>She counts the days until Rainbows Preschool Club on Wednesday night and Sunday School on Sunday mornings. She can&rsquo;t wait to share the memory verse with us that she&rsquo;s learned once we all get loaded up into the car. As a result, our entire family is learning more scripture then even before thanks to the influence of my daughter!<img src="http://www.pcctoday.com/monkimage.php?mediaDirectory=mediafiles&amp;mediaId=1774631&amp;fileName=photo--patti-jensen--emerson-0-0-200-301.jpg" width="200" height="301" alt="PHOTO : Patti Jensen : Emerson" title="PHOTO : Patti Jensen : Emerson" style="float: right;"></p><p><br> I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of volunteering in both the Children&rsquo;s Ministry and the Youth Ministry at Portland Christian Center and let me tell you, it&rsquo;s hard work! However, the rewards of influencing children and youth far outweigh the work involved. To some of these children and youth, you and I are the only light of Jesus they see. Some of them come from homes that don&rsquo;t demonstrate the love of God. Some of the children we teach are brought by neighbors or other relatives. Not every youth or child is fortunate enough to have loving Christian parents that are able to continue the sharing of God&rsquo;s love at home as well as at church.</p><p><br> For that reason, we need to lift up our Children&rsquo;s Ministry and Youth Ministry volunteer teachers and leaders. These teachers and leaders have the opportunity to change and mold the lives of the future. Broken-hearted children and youth come to church each week and often, the teachers and leaders bear the burden of their brokenness with them, encouraging them with prayer, friendship, and even mentoring them. Our volunteers may be the only example of Jesus they will meet.</p><p><br> For our prayer focus today let&rsquo;s pray that God would strengthen these volunteer leaders and teachers, that He would give them strength, energy and endurance. Let&rsquo;s pray that He would richly bless their lives for the sacrifice of their time and that God would call up a new generation of leaders and teachers to impact our children and youth ministries. Maybe God has been calling you to step out in faithfulness and serve somewhere. If so, get in touch with one of the Pastor&rsquo;s at Portland Christian Center and get plugged in. The ministry that happens each Sunday and Wednesday has an impact on eternity through the lives of our youth and children.</p><p>Are you interested in volunteering for our Children's department at Portland Christian Center?

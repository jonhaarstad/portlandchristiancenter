<h4 align="center"><b>INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT'S REVIEW REPORT</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;June 17, 2011</p>
<p>Board of Deacons and Management<b><br />Port land Christian Center</b><br />Portland, Oregon</p>
<p>We have reviewed the accompanying statements of assets, liabilities and net assets &ndash; cash basis, of Portland Christian Center (a nonprofit organization) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of revenue, support and expenses - cash basis, for the years then ended. A review includes primarily applying analytical procedures to management's financial data and making inquiries of organization management. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.</p>
<p>Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the cash basis of accounting and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to conduct the review in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require us to perform procedures to obtain limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements. We believe that the results of our procedures provide a reasonable basis for our report.</p>
<p>Based on our review, with the exception of the matter described in the following paragraph, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying financial statements in order for them to be in conformity with the cash basis of accounting, as described in Note 1.</p>
<p>As disclosed in Note 1, the cash basis of accounting requires that depreciation be recorded on depreciable property purchased after January 1, 1987. Management has informed us that depreciation on additions to property and equipment has not been computed. The effect on this departure on the accompanying financial statements has not been determined.</p>

The question is... "do you have the tools, ingredients and recipe for effective transformational leadership?" Join us this summer for the "Transformational Leadership Workshop". We're offering two formats to fit your schedule. One is a 3-day workshop and the other format will occur on Wednesday nights all summer.</p>
<p>As you probably already know true change is a process, not a one time event. Transformational Leadership is designed to teach essential tools that will take your leadership to the next level at home, work, or church, and give you time to apply what you are learning. It doesn't matter whether you are are leading from the top or the bottom.</p>

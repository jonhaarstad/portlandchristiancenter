HE'S GOING INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL!</strong> &nbsp; So I do what I normally do when I don't know what to do... I read a book.&nbsp; I recently happened upon the book&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shaunti.com/BooksStudies/ForParentsOnly/tabid/139/Default.aspx">For Parents Only</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<span class="goog-spellcheck-word">Shaunti</span>&nbsp;<span class="goog-spellcheck-word">Feldhahn</span>.&nbsp; An insightful book written for parents of teens... and&nbsp;<span class="goog-spellcheck-word">tweens</span>.&nbsp; Great detail is discussed about our children's desire... almost addiction... for freedom.&nbsp; Their need to pull away from their parents... and ultimately... their parents' rules.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We have tried to be consistent with our parenting... often reminding Christopher why he needs to learn obedience.&nbsp; Not because it makes a parent's life any easier... but because we want him to learn how to be obedient to the Lord as he continues to grow in our home... and then on his own. As he has grown older we have begun to share with him a lot of the "whys" of our parenting... especially when it is "no."&nbsp; Still he presents his case... and we express that the guidelines and boundaries we have established are for his benefit.&nbsp; Sometimes... reason just does not matter to a&nbsp;<span class="goog-spellcheck-word">tweenager</span>.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As I have been studying Experiencing God this week, I have been reading about the relationship between God's love for me and His commands.&nbsp; How His commands are for our good... and how his guidelines are used to help us experience His love for us.</div><blockquote><div><i>That is the purpose of God's commands.&nbsp; He wants you to receive life and have it abundantly.&nbsp; When the Lord gives you a command, He is trying to protect and preserve the best He has for you.&nbsp; He does not want you to lose it.&nbsp; When God gives a command, He is not restricting you.&nbsp; He is freeing you.</i><i><span>&nbsp;~ Experiencing God</span></i></div></blockquote><span>And I think of all the times when I thought that the commands that God has given were to restrict me... and now to think of them as freeing me.&nbsp; Freeing me to live the life that He has set aside for me.&nbsp; Freeing me so that I might prosper... and have abundant life.</span></div><div><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>I think of all the times I have stomped my feet and not wanted to hear His "no"... and especially not His reasons for His "no"...&nbsp; and I begin to see where I fight my Heavenly Father to gain my freedom from Him and His commands... And you know what?&nbsp; He'll let me have my freedom.&nbsp; I've had it all along.&nbsp; And I'll rush off and try to do things my way.&nbsp; And I'll experience the things that He has been trying to protect me from all along... And then one day I wake up and realize that He really does love me... and wants to protect me... and He does that by giving me commands... that&nbsp;<b>I</b>&nbsp;obey for&nbsp;<b>my&nbsp;</b>benefit.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>That I obey for my benefit.&nbsp; For my own good.&nbsp; Wow... and I thought parenting a&nbsp;<span class="goog-spellcheck-word">tweenager</span>&nbsp;was hard...</span></div><div><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div>...what does the LORD your God ask of you but&nbsp;</div><div>to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him,&nbsp;</div><div>to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,&nbsp;</div><div>and to observe the&nbsp;<span class="goog-spellcheck-word">LORD's</span>&nbsp;commands and decrees that I am giving you today&nbsp;</div><div><b>for your own good</b>? -&nbsp;Deuteronomy 10:12-13</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sheri Kaetzel</strong></div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div><img src="http://www.pcctoday.com/monkimage.php?mediaDirectory=mediafiles&amp;mediaId=1806893&amp;fileName=graphic--photo--sheri-kaetzel-0-0-200-133.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="GRAPHIC : PHOTO : Sheri Kaetzel" title="GRAPHIC : PHOTO : Sheri Kaetzel"><br><div>&nbsp;</div></div></div>

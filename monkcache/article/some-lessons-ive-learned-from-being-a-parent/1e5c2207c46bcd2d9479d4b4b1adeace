But in the birthing room at the hospital, all  that changed. The moment our first child was born, fatherhood  immediately became very real to me, and suddenly I was enamored with  this new little life, memorized by every little movement, coo, and  facial expression.</p><p>In Matthew 19:14 Jesus said, &ldquo;Let the little children come to me,  and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as  these.&rdquo; As a father, I find myself being a student of my children.  They&rsquo;re helping me understand how God feels about me as my Heavenly  Father.</p><hr><h3>Some Lessons I&rsquo;ve learned from Being a Parent:</h3><h4>Lesson 1: I&rsquo;ve learned that life is a miracle</h4><p>There are so many variables that are beyond our ability control as a  baby grows in his mother&rsquo;s womb. I realize now that the process a baby  goes through from initial conception to birth is an incredible miracle,  completely in God&rsquo;s hands.</p><hr><h4>Lesson 2: I understand God&rsquo;s deep desire to have a relationship with  us as His children</h4><p>There will never be a time when I will want my relationship with my  children to end. Through this, I understand that God, as our perfect  Heavenly Father, feels the same way about me. God has an intense desire  to connect with us, His kids, and to play a meaningful part in our  lives.</p><hr><h4>Lesson 3: I&rsquo;m learning how perfect God is</h4><p>My kids do lots of things that may upset or frustrate me, and sometimes I  may not always react in the best way. But I realize that often, I do  those very same things that bother me when I see my kids doing them. I  know I can bring these frustrations to my Heavenly Father, and God will  always respond to me the right way. He&rsquo;s patient, available, and wants  to help me.</p><hr><h4>Lesson 4: Boundaries are a good thing</h4><p>God has designed a narrow path for us to follow &ndash; to help us, protect  us, and to fulfill His will. The stairs at our house looked like Fort  Knox when our children were very young, with baby gates, latches and  locks. Our children were simply too young and not ready to tackle a  flight of stairs. In the same way, God, our loving Father, helps keep us  going in the right direction by establishing healthy boundaries for us.</p><hr><h4>Lesson 5: Obedience is vital</h4><p>I heard a story once of a mother who took her little son to a park,  which was on a very busy street. For just a moment the mother lost track  of her son, and suddenly caught a glimpse of him about to walk into  oncoming traffic. The mother was too far away to grab him and pull him  to safety. She had no way to stop him, so she simply yelled out, as loud  as she could, &ldquo;Jordan, STOP!&rdquo; Startled, the  child stopped, one step away from a sure death, and turned back around  toward his mother.</p><p>There are times in our lives when we simply need to obey. We don&rsquo;t  need to know why; we just need to trust our Heavenly Father. Also, as  parents know, there are less painful consequences when we obey the first  time!</p><hr><h4>Lesson 6: We quickly claim ownership over things that really belong  to God</h4><p>We quickly latch onto the things of this life, and if we sense God  asking us to make those things available for someone else, our inner  child screams &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine! It&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; My children have reminded me that  we come into this world with nothing and we leave with nothing.  Everything we have belongs to God. Our responsibility is to simply be  good stewards of what we&rsquo;ve been given to oversee, and not resist the  Owner if He asks for those things back. Psalm 24:1 reminds us, &ldquo;The  earth is the Lord&rsquo;s and everything in it.&rdquo;</p><hr><h4>Lesson 7: Parenting requires sacrifice</h4><p>We need to consciously choose to minimize the distractions that can keep  us from fully engaging with our children. Conveniences like computers,  cell phones, jobs, and just the busyness of life can keep us from having  a meaningful relationship with our kids. God sacrificed his Son Jesus  Christ to be able to be with us. He gave everything to bridge the  distance that sin had created. He did so to have a relationship with us.  What is one thing you can do today to brighten your child&rsquo;s day and  spend some meaningful time with him?</p><p>God has a training school for each one of us, wherever we may be in  life. Our responsibility is to engage in the class and pay attention to  the lessons we need to learn.  Fatherhood can be a very engaging  classroom with lots of lessons. I think the most important lessons we  learn are those that we allow to deepen our relationship with God and  with others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;" class="highlight">Portland Christian Center offers several Marriage and Family groups  and classes.<br><a href="/ministries/adult-education/love-and-logic-parenting-classes/becoming-love-and-logic-parent/">Becoming a Love and Logic Parent begins September 8, 2010</a></p></div>

Wanda has served in children's ministry for over 20 years! She has volunteered through all age groups, from rocking the littlest babies, to teaching our elementary children in Sunday School.&nbsp;The kids she once chased as preschoolers are now bringing their own kids to church for her to show God's unconditional love and care.</p><p><strong><em><img src="http://www.pcctoday.com/monkimage.php?mediaDirectory=mediafiles&amp;mediaId=2202023&amp;fileName=profile--volunteer--wanda-baxter-0-0-360-397.jpg" width="360" height="397" alt="Profile : Volunteer : Wanda Baxter" title="Profile : Volunteer : Wanda Baxter">Thank you, Wanda...</em></strong>&nbsp;for your faithfulness, for always being eager to serve where you are most needed, and for sharing so much love with the kids you work with every week.

<h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY: Benjamin Rush</h4>
<i>"Christianity is the only true and perfect religion, and that in proportion as mankind adopt its principles and obey its precepts they will be wise and happy."<strong>- A Medical Doctor and Signer of the Declaration of Independence</strong></i></blockquote>
<h5>Psalm 119:1-4</h5>
<p><b>Blessed are they whose ways are blameless, who walk according to the law of the Lord. Blessed are they who keep His statues and seek Him with all their heart. They do nothing wrong; they walk in His way. You have laid down precepts that are to be fully obeyed.</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>REFLECT AND DISCUSS</h5>
<p><b>Can you name something you have done wrong lately? If you would have followed the truths in the Bible, would this have helped you avoid doing this wrong thing?</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>PRAYER</h5>
<p><i>Turn our faces to You, Lord God. Make us steadfast in obeying Your decrees. (Psalm 119:5) We will praise You with an upright heart as we learn Your righteous laws. (Psalm 119:7) We will obey Your decrees; do not utterly forsake us. (Psalm 119:8)</i></p>

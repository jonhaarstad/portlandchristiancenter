<h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY: John Adams</h4>
<i>"The general principles upon which the Fathers achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity...I will avow that I believed and now believe that those general principles of Christianity are as eternal and immutable as the existence and attributes of God.""(July 4th) ought to be commemorated as the day deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty."<strong>- 1st Vice President of the U.S. and Second President</strong></i></blockquote>
<h5>1 Timothy 1:17</h5>
<p><b>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever.</b></p>

<h5>PRAYER</h5>
<p><i>Heavenly Father, may our national, state and local leaders become mindful that the principles of Christianity were written by You and are eternal, unchangeable, and helpful to people everywhere.</i></p>

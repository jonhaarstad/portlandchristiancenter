<h3 style="text-align: left;" align="center"><i>Widows and Orphans in Africa</i></h3>
<p>In Memory of <strong>Patti Arn</strong>&nbsp;the family has initiated the Patti Arn Memorial Fund. &nbsp;Donations are being directed to build the Women&rsquo;s Development Center in Ethiopia, Africa.&nbsp;<strong>Patti</strong>&nbsp;was using her gifts and talents to help develop a product that could be merchandised here in the states as a sustainability project for widowed women.&nbsp; Most of the women involved were not older than 42 years of age and all of the women have children. &nbsp;As the most poor of Africa the children of these women are unable to go to school because their days are spent on the streets helping to provide for the family through casual labor.</p>
<p><strong>Patti Arn</strong> had personally sponsored a widow, who actually ended up being healed of cancer.&nbsp; We thought that was a sign of her healing as well.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to carry on caring for the poor in honor of our good friend. In an effort to break the chronic cycle of poverty the Women&rsquo;s Development Center provides micro-grants, along with training, to start sustainable small businesses and meaningful work in Africa.&nbsp; The Women&rsquo;s Development Center will house a sewing and craft center along with a training center, internet cafe and bakery.</p>

<h3>Why Invest in Women? Because They Reinvest In Their Families!</h3>
<blockquote>No one works harder to end hunger than a mother with a hungry child.&nbsp;Research has discovered income earned and controlled by women is directly channeled to their children, who eat better, get healthier and stay in school longer. As a powerful solution for change, investing in widowed women, along with the added value of education and life-skill development not only builds families&rsquo; well-being, self worth and self-confidence, but has<b> the power to break the cycle of chronic poverty.</b></blockquote>
<p>At Petros Network we are reaching for an extraordinary dream&hellip;a world free from chronic hunger and poverty to a life of thriving. And, our efforts are matched by the hardworking mothers who are determined to feed their children, safeguard their health and end their poverty.</p>

<h2>Guest Article 31 Days of Prayer - Friendship and Encouragement Go Hand in Hand</h2><div id="sermon-info" class="sermon"><ul class="sermon-buttons"></ul><!-- .sermon-buttons --><p class="sermon-meta">Posted Oct 30th, 2012 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Series: 31 Day Prayer Guide </p></div><!-- .sermon --><div id="text"><blockquote>During our 31 Days of Prayer focus, we are posting a few guest articles to give perspective to certain prayer focuses. Today we are focusing on praying for our friends. Our guest writer Patti Jensen, mother of two, real estate agent, wife, and writer describes how friendship can benefit both us and those we befriend, both the lovable and unlovable.</blockquote><h4>As Jesus prayed the prayer that we read in today&rsquo;s verse from John 17:25-26, I can only imagine the passion that was surging through His heart.</h4><p>&ldquo;Father, I want those you gave me to be with me, right where I am....&rdquo;. Jesus understood the burden that we bear for our friends and he longed for His friends to know His Father the way that He did. He longed for his friends to experience the love of God in a life transforming way, the way he had.</p><p><br> Whenever we experience something new and exciting, it&rsquo;s natural to want to share that with friends. After all, what is the tag line of most postcards that you buy on vacation? &ldquo;Wish you were here!&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s natural to want to share something wonderful with those you care about. Becoming a wife and mother is something that has changed my life and blessed me beyond anything I could have ever imagined! I have friends in my life that aren&rsquo;t at that stage in life yet and I can&rsquo;t wait for them to join me and experience the same joys that I have. I want them to be right there with me! I want the best for my friends.</p><p><br> With that being said, when I am with my friends I want to be a good steward of my faith and give my testimony of God&rsquo;s goodness in my life to my friends. In Hebrews it says, &ldquo;And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another...&rdquo; Hebrews 10:24-25a.</p><p><br> My prayer is that my friendships, my life, and my testimony spurs on my friends towards love and good deeds and encourages them. I can do this by praying for them, being a listening ear, encouraging them with scripture, speaking the truth in love, and placing their needs above my own. This can be difficult with the best of friends, but what about those friends who are more difficult? It can be challenging to be a true friend to the person in our lives who&rsquo;s always complaining about something. That is not as fun or easy of a task. Yet, Jesus was friend to the friendless and calls us to do the same.</p><p><br> For today&rsquo;s prayer focus, let&rsquo;s lift up our friends to God; pray that we would be sensitive to their needs and burdens, that our lives would spur them on towards love and good deeds and bring out the best in them. Let&rsquo;s also pray that God would bring people into our lives that need a friend in Jesus and that we can be that for them.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Patti Jensen</strong></p><p><img src="http://www.pcctoday.com/monkimage.php?mediaDirectory=mediafiles&amp;mediaId=1774635&amp;fileName=graphic--photo--patti-jensen-0-0-250-250.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="GRAPHIC : photo : Patti Jensen" title="GRAPHIC : photo : Patti Jensen" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Portland Christian Center is multigenerational christian church located at 5700 SW Dosch Rd Portland, Oregon. &nbsp;If you are looking for a welcoming church in the Portland area come visit our 9 or 10:45 services. &nbsp;Our congregants come from Sherwood, Tualatin, Lake Oswego, Tigard, Beaverton, and the greater Portland area.</strong></p></div>

<h2>The Gospel Made Real in the Alpha Course</h2><div id="sermon-info" class="sermon"><ul class="sermon-buttons"></ul><!-- .sermon-buttons --><p class="sermon-meta">Posted Aug 15th, 2011 &nbsp;  </p></div><!-- .sermon --><div id="text"><p>Do you ever think the Gospel is too basic? Do you ever say &ldquo;the Gospel is just the A,B,C,&rsquo;s of Christianity&rdquo;? Don&rsquo;t tell the angels that! In 1 Peter 1:12, it says that &ldquo;angels long to look into these [the Gospel] things.&rdquo; The Gospel is so powerful and so vast, even angels passionately desire to examine it. It&rsquo;s that powerful. And we've seen that power at work recently in the Alpha Course.</p>
<p>In our first round of Alpha, we've seen some small but significant examples of the power in the Gospel:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've seen a distinguished man openly admit why he doesn't pray and he wasn't judged or criticized.</li>
<li>We've seen a successful businessman readily ask for help in growing as a Christian.</li>
<li>We've seen people voluntarily move out of their comfort zone, sitting next to total strangers simply to make them feel welcomed.</li>
<li>We've watched a group of strangers start sharing their life&rsquo;s pain in matters of divorce, adultery, alcoholism, and disappointment with God, all in the safety of a small group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistically, none of these should have happened&mdash;these people hadn't been together long enough to build trust. Except it did happen! That&rsquo;s Alpha.</p>
<p>Alpha is not just about information; it&rsquo;s about community and experiencing the power of the Holy Spirit as He guides our actions to reflect His character of love and compassion. Even if you have been a Christian for a long time, I challenge you to TAKE the Alpha Course. It has invigorated my spiritual life in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel more confident in witnessing than ever before.</li>
<li>I have new insight in how the Holy Spirit is at work in everything, even when things go wrong.</li>
<li>And, I don&rsquo;t worry about what to say when people ask tough spiritual questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know people who don&rsquo;t know Christ, I would encourage you to <strong>BRING THEM</strong> to the Alpha Course.  If you have ever wondered how to explain the Gospel to people who are hostile to Christianity, <strong>TAKE</strong> the Alpha Course. You will discover that the Gospel is far more than the A,B,C&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s the answer to the questions of life.</p>

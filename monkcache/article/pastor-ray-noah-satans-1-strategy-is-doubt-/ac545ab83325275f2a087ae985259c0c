<h2>Pastor Ray Noah: Satan's #1 Strategy is Doubt ...</h2><div id="sermon-info" class="sermon"><ul class="sermon-buttons"></ul><!-- .sermon-buttons --><p class="sermon-meta">Posted Apr 10th, 2013 &nbsp;  </p></div><!-- .sermon --><div id="text"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Shift Your Focus&hellip;</b>From the Word of God in general, from human experience&mdash;mine and other people I&rsquo;ve witnessed over the years&mdash;and from this story in particular, I could make a pretty strong case that doubt is the number one strategy Satan uses in our lives to disrupt, weaken and ultimately destroy our faith in God.&nbsp; If he can get us to question the goodness and sufficiency of God and his Word, then our spirituality will be dead in the water.</p>
<hr />
<p class="highlight">EVERY TIME&nbsp;the devil came at Jesus with a temptation, the very first word was <strong><i>&ldquo;if&rdquo;</i> &mdash;<i>&ldquo;if you are the Son of God&hellip;if you will kneel and worship me&hellip;&rdquo; </i>&nbsp;(Matthew 4:3,5,9).</strong> Behind Satan&rsquo;s enticements was the goal of getting Jesus to question God&rsquo;s care and competence as well as his identity as the cherished Son of God.</p>
<hr />
<p>That is exactly what Satan will do to you&mdash;most likely even today.&nbsp; He will cause a question to arise in your mind as to the reliability of God&rsquo;s Word, the dependability of God&rsquo;s love, the sufficiency of God&rsquo;s supply, and the truthfulness of your unmovable place as a cherished child of God.&nbsp; Just like clockwork, the <strong><i>&ldquo;if&rdquo; </i></strong>question will be sown as a seed of doubt in your spirit before the day is out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number one defense against Satan&rsquo;s strategy to destroy your faith is trust&mdash;ruthless trust.&nbsp; Each occasion in which Jesus was hit with the big <strong><i>&ldquo;if&rdquo;</i></strong> was met with a return to what was unquestionable, unshakable and immovable&mdash;the Word of God.&nbsp; Jesus&rsquo; answer to the assault on his faith?&nbsp; <i>&ldquo;Scripture says&hellip;&rdquo;</i> (Matt. 4:4,7,10)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus stood on the promises of Scripture, knowing that obedience to it was the only way to God&rsquo;s provision (<i>&ldquo;man shall not live by bread alone&rdquo;</i>), true spiritual muscle (<i>&ldquo;jump off&rdquo;</i> and prove your divine power), and ceaseless kingdom authority<i> </i>(<i>&ldquo;all the kingdoms of the world will be yours&rdquo;</i>).&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="highlight">Trust&mdash;ruthless trust. No assault from the enemy can penetrate it, and no temptation, regardless of the power of its enticement, can hold a candle against it.&nbsp; So no matter what, lean into God&rsquo;s Word today&mdash;there is nothing in all creation as reliable.&nbsp; Trust in God&rsquo;s character&mdash;his care and competence have never been proven impotent.&nbsp; Wait patiently for his provision&mdash;it will never lack the satisfaction you truly need.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Analyze the things that are tempting you today.&nbsp; Find out how they assault your trust in the reliability of God&rsquo;s Word, the sufficiency of God&rsquo;s provision and the immutability of your position as a cherished child of God.&nbsp; Once you do that, you will see what temptation promises as nothing more than a false infinite&mdash;something that in the light of day cannot hold a candle to what God has in store for those who ruthlessly trust him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, when you respond to temptation with ruthless trust, not only do you punch Satan in the nose, but you give a priceless gift to God. I love what Brennan Manning says in his book, Ruthless Trust,</p>
<p><i></i><i>&ldquo;The splendor of a human heart which trusts that it is loved gives God more pleasure than Westminster Cathedral, the Sistine Chapel, Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth Symphony, Van Gogh&rsquo;s Sunflowers, the sight of ten thousand butterflies in flight, or the scent of a million orchids in bloom.&nbsp; Trust is our gift back to God, and he finds it so enchanting that Jesus died for love of it.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So throughout the day today, look up, smile, and trust!</p>
<blockquote>Unwavering trust is a rare and precious thing because it often demands a degree of courage that borders on the heroic.&rdquo; ~Brennan Manning</blockquote>

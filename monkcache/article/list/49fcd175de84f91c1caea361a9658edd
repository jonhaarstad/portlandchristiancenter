<h3 style="text-align: left;" align="center"><i>Widows and Orphans in Africa</i></h3>
<p>In Memory of <strong>Patti Arn</strong>&nbsp;the family has initiated the Patti Arn Memorial Fund. &nbsp;Donations are being directed to build the Women&rsquo;s Development Center in Ethiopia, Africa.&nbsp;<strong>Patti</strong>&nbsp;was using her gifts and talents to help develop a product that could be merchandised here in the states as a sustainability project for widowed women.&nbsp; Most of the women involved were not older than 42 years of age and all of the women have children. &nbsp;As the most poor of Africa the children of these women are unable to go to school because their days are spent on the streets helping to provide for the family through casual labor.</p>
<p><strong>Patti Arn</strong> had personally sponsored a widow, who actually ended up being healed of cancer.&nbsp; We thought that was a sign of her healing as well.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to carry on caring for the poor in honor of our good friend. In an effort to break the chronic cycle of poverty the Women&rsquo;s Development Center provides micro-grants, along with training, to start sustainable small businesses and meaningful work in Africa.&nbsp; The Women&rsquo;s Development Center will house a sewing and craft center along with a training center, internet cafe and bakery.</p>

<h3>Why Invest in Women? Because They Reinvest In Their Families!</h3>
<blockquote>No one works harder to end hunger than a mother with a hungry child.&nbsp;Research has discovered income earned and controlled by women is directly channeled to their children, who eat better, get healthier and stay in school longer. As a powerful solution for change, investing in widowed women, along with the added value of education and life-skill development not only builds families&rsquo; well-being, self worth and self-confidence, but has<b> the power to break the cycle of chronic poverty.</b></blockquote>
<p>At Petros Network we are reaching for an extraordinary dream&hellip;a world free from chronic hunger and poverty to a life of thriving. And, our efforts are matched by the hardworking mothers who are determined to feed their children, safeguard their health and end their poverty.</p>

<p>Author and lecturer, Fouad Masri, was born and raised in the war zone of Beirut, Lebanon. As a third generation pastor, he has a passion for sharing the love of Christ with Muslims and has spent most of his life doing just that. &nbsp;After coming to the United States to attend seminary, Fouad realized the urgency for teaching American Christians to reach out to our rapidly growing population of internationals, particularly Muslims.</p>
<blockquote>Our job is not to make the Muslim a Christian. Our job is to show them the love of Christ.</blockquote>
<p>Fouad Masri is an ordained minister who has been ministering to Muslims since 1979.&nbsp;He has trained more than 18,000 Christians to sensitively and purposefully share their faith with Muslims through both the <em>Bridges One-Day</em> and <em>Sahara Challenge</em> training programs.&nbsp;In 1989, he founded the <a href="http://www.crescentproject.org">Crescent Project</a> to nurture transformational relationships between Christians and Muslims and overcome misconceptions about Islam and Christianity.&nbsp;He has served as a guest instructor at universities and Christian ministries and has been featured in media publications, including Christianity Today, Newsweek, Mission Network News, and on CBN, TBN, the Janet Parshall Show, and Prime Time America.</p>
<h4>An Important Message for Our Cross-Cultural Training</h4>
<p>Fouad Masri returns to Portland Christian Center on Sunday, July 28th for our 9:00 and 10:45 AM Celebration services.&nbsp;He will share the real-life transformations which can occur in our community as we all learn more about our Muslim neighbors and <a href="/taking-the-fear-out-of-islam/">Take The Fear Out of Islam</a>.

<h2>Article: The Christian Response to Islam</h2>
<p><em>Reprinted from <a href="http://voiceofchristmedia.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=155:the-christian-response-to-muslims-v15-155&amp;catid=38&amp;Itemid=264" title="Voice of Christ Media">Voice of Christ Media Ministries</a>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Christians have been asking many questions about Muslims.&nbsp; Who are they and what do they believe?</p>
<p>Do all Muslims sanction violence?&nbsp; Most importantly, what attitude should Christians have toward them?&nbsp; Why do some Muslims use the Koran to justify violence while others condemn it?</p>
<p>These are all important questions.</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming Stereotypes</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It is important to understand that not all Muslims are terrorists. In fact, only a small number of them promote violence. Most are decent, peace-loving people.</p>
<p>Some are quite secular in their outlook and way of life. They claim to be Muslims but do not faithfully practice their religion. They may not even know much about its teachings. Other moderate Muslims believe Islam is just a religion and try to practice it faithfully. Most are peace loving and generally only use peaceful persuasion to make converts. They are often embarrassed by acts of terrorism that are carried out in the name of Islam.</p>
<p>Fundamentalist Muslims, on the other hand, have a political as well as a religious agenda. They believe everyone should live in submission to Islamic law. They take the teaching of the Koran and Mohammed's commands to fight for the cause of Allah literally and believe violence is justified for taking control of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong and Right Responses to Muslims</strong></p>
<p>Muslims around the world are watching to see how Christians respond to them. How we react to them may very well determine whether we draw attention to the Gospel or obscure it.</p>
<p>We have an unprecedented opportunity to reach out to Muslims by demonstrating the love of Christ.&nbsp; This is not to say that we must close our eyes and simply overlook acts of violence. Scripture teaches that those in authority have been empowered by God to punish the responsible ones (I Peter 2:13-14).</p>
<p>But, individually, we must never respond with hatred or revenge. To do so is not the way of Christ. "For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps. While being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously" (I Peter 2:21, 23).</p>
<p>In his editorial in the October 27, 2001, issue of World magazine, John Piper said it well when he warned of the danger of falling into the sin of hatred.</p>
<p>"The spirit of revenge sends the false signal that Christ is not an all-sufficient, all-satisfying Savior. We justify our own little jihad, and seek our satisfaction by injuring the adversary. But true Christians treasure Jesus above vengeance."</p>
<p>However, neither is it right to cave in to the shrill voices that are preaching a warped view of tolerance and saying that all religions, including Islam, lead to God. Piper said this emphasis is equally wrong.</p>
<p>"In reaction against indiscriminate hate there is now a stampede to pluralism and twisted tolerance. If Muslims are hated, then let us call ecumenical gatherings, and let us all praise the virtues of Islam and the wisdom of Allah and the goodness of Mohammed. But let no one speak the intolerable and indispensable truth that Jesus is the only way to God."</p>
<p>Jesus clearly said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through me" (John 14:6). We should never hesitate to boldly say that the only way to God is through the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>To react to Muslims by falling into these equally wrong traps of hatred and tolerance is to hide the message of eternal life from them. Both of these attitudes are wrong and keep Muslims in spiritual darkness. Let us stand against these sins and instead focus on lovingly sharing with them the message of salvation through Jesus Christ and His finished work on the Cross.</p>
<p><strong>Loving in Jesus' Name</strong></p>
<p>You can make a huge difference by praying for Muslim nations and individuals in them. In fact, when fear begins to grip your mind, stop and pray for Muslims -- even those who promote terrorism!! Pray for Muslims to have open hearts and for the Gospel to reach them. Ask God to raise up workers to help evangelize Muslim countries. Pray for those like the Voice of Christ Media team who are already doing this.</p>
<p>Then ask God to use you to befriend and evangelize the Muslims you know. Show them practical love. Be loving and humble. Don't advocate a particular culture or political agenda. Focus on Jesus Christ and His uniqueness. Offer to study the life of Christ with them by reading through one of the Gospels. Ask God to give them spiritual understanding and to draw them to faith in Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the only answer. Ask God to show you what part He wants you to have in evangelizing Muslims. Trust Him to use you to reach out to them with loving, courageous witness.</p>

<blockquote>We came across this great article by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://headandheartparent.com/contact-shelly-love-and-logic/">Shelly Moorman, founder of&nbsp;Head and Heart Parent</a>&nbsp;we thought was excellent:</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5 Steps to Sanity This Summer</h2>
<p>As much as I love the summer break I also stress thinking about &ldquo;What am I going to do with my kids this summer?&rdquo;&rdquo; How am I going to keep them busy and not zoning in front of TV or computer?&rdquo; &ldquo;When am I going to get things done?&rdquo; Instead of dreading summer, use these ideas for making this a great summer for you and your children!</p>
<h4>1. Hold a Family Meeting</h4>
<p>Let everyone share their views on what will make the summer a success. Make a list of chores and divide up responsibility among all family members so every feels like they are contributing and a valued member of the team. Children can contribute more in the summer since they don&rsquo;t have homework.</p>
<h4>2. Agree on Rules</h4>
<p>Family meetings are a good time to decide upon summer rules for &ldquo;screen time,&rdquo; reading, activities, play dates and more. Ask the kids what they think is reasonable and negotiate from there. One summer my 9 year old son volunteered the rule for 2 hours of screen time a day and you could earn more screen time for every hour you read. Since this was his idea, it was much easier to get his cooperation to comply all summer long and I was thrilled.</p>
<h4>3. Explore Your Options</h4>
<p>Look into what is available for your child in your community this summer and what would be fun for you?</p>
<ul class="list_002">
<li>Check out the Parks &amp; Recreation Centers for mini camps, outings, and sports.</li>
<li>Explore community water parks in your area and visit a different one each week. My favorites are in Littleton and Golden.</li>
<li>Google &ldquo;free factory tours&rdquo; and plan outings. My favorites are Hammond Candy and Celestial Seasonings.</li>
<li>Join multiple library systems summer reading programs and local bookstores. If your kids finish one program they can work on the next to keep them motivated to read all summer long.</li>
<li>Go on a hike! I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Jefferson County Open Spaces for kid friendly hikes within 30-45 minute drive. My favorite is Lair 0&rsquo;Bear for a stream to play in, easy hike, and great picnic spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Structure Your Routine</h4>
<p>Decide what your family&rsquo;s general daily routine will be with set bedtimes, TV times, outdoor times, mealtimes, quiet times, whatever works for you. Routines can make a big difference in your child&rsquo;s behavior and your sanity.</p>
<h4>5. Make Time for Yourself</h4>
<p>Taking care of yourself and your marriage is vital if you are to have the resources for coping with the constant demands and stress of parenting.</p>
<ul class="list_002">
<li>Get up early and let your kids sleep late to find some quiet time.</li>
<li>Trade with another parent to watch kids so you can run errands.</li>
<li>Plan parent-child date so one parent take the children out every week giving the other parent a chance to relax with the house all to themselves.</li>
<li>Plan date night each week for you and your spouse to go out together without the children or for the children to go elsewhere while you two stay at home alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I have prayed for our church and the great people of Portland Christian Center, God has spoke to me so clearly, "It is time for the Church of Jesus Christ to wake up and prepare for action!" Friends, as we look at the world around us we can't help but notice our time here on earth is short and no longer can we have a business-as-usual approach to life. For certain, we face obstacles and opposition, but also the harvest is unusually ripe and the opportunities for kingdom advancement are great. <strong>And, the good news is for all we face here on earth, we have this certain promise that the future belongs to God&rsquo;s people&mdash;if we are prepared!</strong></p>
<hr />
<h4></h4>
<h4>You might be asking what does this mean for me?</h4>
<p>My job as your Lead Pastor is to prepare you! Through sermon series, midweek connection classes, Sunday morning groups/classes, special guests and outreach opportunities...you will see our focus in 2013 to prepare the church in these Four Calls to Action in 2013:</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">1. &nbsp;Prepare for Christ&rsquo;s Return</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>&ldquo;Wake up, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.&rdquo;</i> ~Romans 13:11</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">THE CALL:&nbsp; The signs are clear and the evidence is undeniable: The time for Christ&rsquo;s promised return is nearer than ever before.&nbsp; God is calling his church to prepare the Second Coming and to live ready to go in a moment&rsquo;s notice&mdash;which means living in such a way that we are investing in the things today that will matter in the light of eternity.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="http://www.pcctoday.com/extras/sermons-download/">Check out the Sermon Series:&nbsp; I &amp; II Thessalonians, "In A Twinkling of An Eye" </a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">2. &nbsp;Prepare for a Coming Economic Earthquake</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>&ldquo;Will not your debtors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their victim.&rdquo;</i> ~Habakkuk 2:7<b><i></i></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">THE CALL: There are an increasing number of prophetic voices warning of a coming economic collapse.&nbsp; Over the last few years, we have witnessed globally and felt personally the shakings of our long-trusted financial foundations. Now God is calling his people, individually and corporately, live by the financial principles of his Word&mdash;which means getting out and staying out of debt, honoring the storehouse principle and being free to invest in the things that matter in light of eternity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="http://www.pcctoday.com/ministries/adult-education/">Check out Financial Peace, and the LifeSkills Class&nbsp;</a></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">3. &nbsp;Prepare to Reach the World of Islam&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcctoday.com/ministries/adult-education/"></a></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>&ldquo;Wake up and look around. The fields are already ripe for harvest.&rdquo;</i> ~John 4:35</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">THE CALL:&nbsp; God is stirring the hearts of Islamic people throughout the world.&nbsp; Through dreams, visions and the courageous witness of God&rsquo;s people, Muslims are coming to Christ by the thousands.&nbsp; Now God is calling our church to plant ant churches among Muslim background people&mdash;both abroad, and right here in Portland.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Check out the Midweek Connection in July for a special training series. And, our special guest on Sunday, July 28&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">4. &nbsp;Prepare for Spiritual Warfare</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>&ldquo;Be on your guard and stay awake. Your enemy, the devil, is like a roaring lion, sneaking around to find someone to attack. But you must resist the devil and stay strong in your faith.&rdquo;</i> ~I Peter 5:8-9</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">THE CALL:&nbsp; God&rsquo;s Kingdom is advancing in unprecedented ways, but that doesn&rsquo;t means the god of this age will give up territory that he has long held without a fight.&nbsp; The voice of the Spirit is clear, and God&rsquo;s people step forward in faith to follow God&rsquo;s call, spiritual opposition and out-and-out warfare will increase. Now God is calling his people to prepare for war by learning the art of spiritual warfare&mdash;which means that we must become alert and armed for Satanic intrusion through demonic harassment, devilish pressure and outright persecution.</p>

We all ought to be Abraham-like in the spiritual dimension of our lives. ...||Ray Noah||May 17 2013||<div id="verses">
<p class="scripture"><strong><strong>Together in 5<strong><strong>&times;</strong></strong>5&times;5 Bible Reading Plan</strong></strong></p>
<p class="scripture"><strong><strong>Read:&nbsp;</strong>Romans 4 <strong> Meditation: </strong>Romans 4:16<strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s promise of eternal life is received through the same kind of faith demonstrated by Abraham, who believed in the God who resurrects the dead and creates new things out of nothing.&rdquo;</blockquote>
</div>
<p><b>Shift Your Focus&hellip;</b> I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve done much thinking about Abraham, but what a true hero of the faith! Here&rsquo;s a guy who was saved by faith even before there was a Bible or the Law or Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection or a community of faith. God appeared to Abraham one day&mdash;we&rsquo;re not even sure if he&rsquo;d had any previous interaction with God or if this was simply an out of the blue encounter&mdash;and Abraham said, &ldquo;Okay God&mdash;I&rsquo;m on board. What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abraham then went on a life-long journey with God in which he became known as a friend of God&mdash;a pretty cool designation, I&rsquo;d say&mdash;the genetic father of God&rsquo;s people, the Jews, and the spiritual father of all who believe. (James 2:23, Romans 4:16-17)</p>
<p>Obviously, Abraham was a very special man, and the Bible holds him up as an example to emulate for believers like you and me. We all ought to be Abraham-like in the spiritual dimension of our lives.</p>
<p>But is that even possible? Is there even the smallest chance that I can develop that same kind of Abraham-like relationship with God? Can I attain a walk with God that will be an Abraham-like example to others? &nbsp;And if it&rsquo;s possible, then how?</p>
<p>Well, it is possible!&nbsp; Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;God will count us righteous too if we believe in him who raised from the dead this Jesus who died for our sins and was raised to make us right with God.&rdquo; &nbsp;(Romans 4:24, NLT)</p>
<p>How can we attain friendship with God?&nbsp; I can sum up the &ldquo;how&rdquo; in two words: Faith and hope&mdash;technically, that&rsquo;s three words, but work with me!</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you&rsquo;ve got to make resurrection the foundation of your faith.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s what Abraham did! Romans 4:17 says, &ldquo;Abraham believed in the God who brings back the dead to life.&rdquo; Abraham was a little ahead of his time&mdash;like a few thousand years&mdash;but he believed in the God of the resurrection. What Paul is referring to here is the story of God&rsquo;s call to Abraham to sacrifice his only son Isaac on the altar (you can read the story in Genesis 22), and Abraham&rsquo;s willingness to actually go through with it. Why would Abraham be willing to do such a thing? Because he had faith in the God of the resurrection&mdash;the God who could, and would, raise Isaac back to life again.</p>
<p>The truth is, to have that kind of Abraham-like faith, you and I have to have that same Abraham-like trust in the God of the resurrection. If you don&rsquo;t have a foundational and resolute belief in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, and his promise to resurrect you from the dead, your faith will not only not develop to Abraham-like proportions, it will be meaningless. Paul teaches us in I Corinthians 15:14, &ldquo;If Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, if we have no faith in the God of the resurrection, then I am wasting my energy writing this blog&hellip;and you&rsquo;re wasting your time reading it&hellip;and you&rsquo;ll never come close to living an Abraham-like life of faith. But the historical fact of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead proves that God is who he said he is and will fulfill what he has promised to do. And the faith you place in the God who resurrects the dead will empower you to live the kind of God-honoring faith that Abraham had.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, you&rsquo;ve got to claim resurrection as the basis of your hope. That, too, is what Abraham did. Romans 4:18 tells us that &ldquo;even when there was no reason for hope, Abraham kept on hoping&rdquo;&hellip;believing in God&rsquo;s promises that one day he would be the father of many nations when his only son, through whom his lineage would continue, was about to die. In other words, Abraham didn&rsquo;t let his circumstances dominate his life; he allowed God&rsquo;s promises to dictate his life. Abraham believed that if Isaac was going to die on the altar, God would raise him to life. That was his hope.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever thought about this, but the exercise of that kind of hope is arguably the most powerful discipline you can engage as a believer. Count Bismarck said, &ldquo;Without the hope of [Christian resurrection], this life is not worth the effort of getting dressed in the morning.&rdquo; He was right! Christian hope is that important, and that powerful.</p>
<p>Karl Marx proclaimed that religious hope is the opiate of the people. But Hebrews 6:19 says, &ldquo;We have this hope as an anchor of the soul, firm and secure.&rdquo; And Paul writes in Romans 5:5 that this &ldquo;hope does not disappoint us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you practice hope? I&rsquo;m not talking about the breezy kind of optimism that Mary Martin sang about in South Pacific when she crooned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck like a dope with a thing called hope.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m talking about the exercise of hope that declares that you are choosing to believe in God&rsquo;s promises, not just in spite of the evidence, but in scorn of the consequences. We&rsquo;ve been called to practice that kind of hope.</p>
<p>Faith, hope and the resurrection&hellip;that was Abraham&rsquo;s secret. I have faith that it will be your secret too&hellip;at least I hope so!&nbsp; He is risen!</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;For a mere legend about Christ&rsquo;s resurrection to have gained circulation and to have had the impact it had without one shred of basis in fact, is [unbelievable].&rdquo;<b> </b>~William F. Albright</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prayer...&nbsp;Thank you that by grace through faith, I am now your beloved child, a part of your forever family!</strong></p>

<p><b>Shift Your Focus&hellip;</b>From the Word of God in general, from human experience&mdash;mine and other people I&rsquo;ve witnessed over the years&mdash;and from this story in particular, I could make a pretty strong case that doubt is the number one strategy Satan uses in our lives to disrupt, weaken and ultimately destroy our faith in God.&nbsp; If he can get us to question the goodness and sufficiency of God and his Word, then our spirituality will be dead in the water.</p>
<hr />
<p class="highlight">EVERY TIME&nbsp;the devil came at Jesus with a temptation, the very first word was <strong><i>&ldquo;if&rdquo;</i> &mdash;<i>&ldquo;if you are the Son of God&hellip;if you will kneel and worship me&hellip;&rdquo; </i>&nbsp;(Matthew 4:3,5,9).</strong> Behind Satan&rsquo;s enticements was the goal of getting Jesus to question God&rsquo;s care and competence as well as his identity as the cherished Son of God.</p>
<hr />
<p>That is exactly what Satan will do to you&mdash;most likely even today.&nbsp; He will cause a question to arise in your mind as to the reliability of God&rsquo;s Word, the dependability of God&rsquo;s love, the sufficiency of God&rsquo;s supply, and the truthfulness of your unmovable place as a cherished child of God.&nbsp; Just like clockwork, the <strong><i>&ldquo;if&rdquo; </i></strong>question will be sown as a seed of doubt in your spirit before the day is out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number one defense against Satan&rsquo;s strategy to destroy your faith is trust&mdash;ruthless trust.&nbsp; Each occasion in which Jesus was hit with the big <strong><i>&ldquo;if&rdquo;</i></strong> was met with a return to what was unquestionable, unshakable and immovable&mdash;the Word of God.&nbsp; Jesus&rsquo; answer to the assault on his faith?&nbsp; <i>&ldquo;Scripture says&hellip;&rdquo;</i> (Matt. 4:4,7,10)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus stood on the promises of Scripture, knowing that obedience to it was the only way to God&rsquo;s provision (<i>&ldquo;man shall not live by bread alone&rdquo;</i>), true spiritual muscle (<i>&ldquo;jump off&rdquo;</i> and prove your divine power), and ceaseless kingdom authority<i> </i>(<i>&ldquo;all the kingdoms of the world will be yours&rdquo;</i>).&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="highlight">Trust&mdash;ruthless trust. No assault from the enemy can penetrate it, and no temptation, regardless of the power of its enticement, can hold a candle against it.&nbsp; So no matter what, lean into God&rsquo;s Word today&mdash;there is nothing in all creation as reliable.&nbsp; Trust in God&rsquo;s character&mdash;his care and competence have never been proven impotent.&nbsp; Wait patiently for his provision&mdash;it will never lack the satisfaction you truly need.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Analyze the things that are tempting you today.&nbsp; Find out how they assault your trust in the reliability of God&rsquo;s Word, the sufficiency of God&rsquo;s provision and the immutability of your position as a cherished child of God.&nbsp; Once you do that, you will see what temptation promises as nothing more than a false infinite&mdash;something that in the light of day cannot hold a candle to what God has in store for those who ruthlessly trust him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, when you respond to temptation with ruthless trust, not only do you punch Satan in the nose, but you give a priceless gift to God. I love what Brennan Manning says in his book, Ruthless Trust,</p>
<p><i></i><i>&ldquo;The splendor of a human heart which trusts that it is loved gives God more pleasure than Westminster Cathedral, the Sistine Chapel, Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth Symphony, Van Gogh&rsquo;s Sunflowers, the sight of ten thousand butterflies in flight, or the scent of a million orchids in bloom.&nbsp; Trust is our gift back to God, and he finds it so enchanting that Jesus died for love of it.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So throughout the day today, look up, smile, and trust!</p>
<blockquote>Unwavering trust is a rare and precious thing because it often demands a degree of courage that borders on the heroic.&rdquo; ~Brennan Manning</blockquote>

Ortmann</strong></p><p>The new neighbors did not look very nice. In fact, I was repelled. I was also alarmed as they unloaded dog and cat.&nbsp; We feed birds and there is a &ldquo;no free-running cats&rdquo; rule in our apartment complex.&nbsp; The new neighbor didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; She said her cat wasn&rsquo;t used to being indoors.&nbsp; There was an instant clash of personalities.&nbsp; You know how it is when you first meet someone and you dislike them on sight?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how it was.&nbsp; I also sensed darkness there.</p><p>I prayed they wouldn&rsquo;t last long, since the neighbors below us seem to be almost on a revolving door situation with many move-ins and outs.&nbsp; Before any time passed, the dog&mdash;a small one with a shrill bark (right under my office window) became a terrible annoyance.&nbsp; In fact, I had to try to drown it out with earmuffs, radio (I usually work with no noise) and a fan.&nbsp; It got so that when I heard the first bark, I jolted upright and my stomach tightened.&nbsp; I admit I got angry and frustrated.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to go to the manager, because the dog was just doing what dogs do, but the irritation persisted and got worse.</p><p>I tried being a little friendly with the people, but the woman was very abrasive and it seemed like every attempt met with some sort of disagreement.&nbsp; I prayed fervently that they would move soon.&nbsp; She also told me she was involved with some sort of New Age thing, which would explain the darkness I felt.&nbsp; I decided to ignore the situation and continued to pray for a quick removal of them from my life.&nbsp; My attitude was less than &ldquo;Christian.&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew it, but didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to change it, even when I prayed for them.&nbsp; I just felt irritated each time I saw them.</p><p><strong>At that time, we were studying about offenses in our Sunday school class.</strong>&nbsp; I honestly was offended by these people and though normally outgoing, I shrunk from any contact with them.&nbsp; I almost sneered when I thought about them.&nbsp; Through the study, I felt a nudging about truly praying for them with an open heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nope, not me.&nbsp; Just move &lsquo;em out, Lord.&nbsp; That will work for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; My attitude was atrocious, but I couldn&rsquo;t seem to force anything else out of myself.</p><p>In the past, God had this interesting way of putting people in my life who drove me up a wall.&nbsp; The more they did so, the more they seemed to be in my life.&nbsp; If I tried to avoid them, somehow they chose me to sit next to, or they wanted to talk to me.&nbsp; Only after fighting it and deciding to pray seriously for them, did I find any peace.&nbsp; This happened over and over and although we didn&rsquo;t become best friends, at least I could tolerate them (big of me, right?).</p><p>Still, this neighbor was something else.&nbsp; I mean, I had to see her many times in the day, if not in person, at least from my window.&nbsp; My sense of revulsion grew.&nbsp; I wrestled with God over this issue.&nbsp; The dog got nastier and even tried to snap at me once, which didn&rsquo;t endear her to me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at all.&nbsp; My sense of being put-upon rose.</p><p>&ldquo;Why me, God?&nbsp; Why is it always me?&nbsp; I just enjoy peace and I get along with all the other neighbors.&nbsp; Why me?&rdquo; I whined.&nbsp;</p><p>One day, I realized that the man was no longer there.&nbsp; I had heard he had lost his job, so I assumed he found a job somewhere else temporarily.&nbsp; After months, I asked her and she said he had left her and they had divorced.&nbsp; She was trying to find work but it was difficult.&nbsp; To my shame, I thought, &ldquo;Oh, yay.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t be able to afford this apartment and will be out of here in no time.&rdquo;</p><p>Bit by bit, as I prayed, I thought I should be feeling some compassion, not just looking out for my own interests.&nbsp; I am normally a very compassionate person, so this in itself was surprising that I didn&rsquo;t feel any.&nbsp; I am also not a selfish person.&nbsp; My shame grew, yet I felt helpless to change my feelings and reach out to her.</p><p>The day before Christmas, I decided to write a short Christmas card and stick it through her mail slot. I could do that without having to talk to her.&nbsp; I saw her the day after Christmas, and asked her how she was.&nbsp; To my surprise, she told me it was the worst Christmas in her life.&nbsp; She said my card was the only card she got and it was the first Christmas without any gifts.&nbsp; Tears welled in her eyes.</p><p>I felt the first twinges of pity.&nbsp; I could identify with her feelings.&nbsp; We parted company and I had a thought.&nbsp; I had an extra stocking and my book <i>From a Cry of Anguish to a Shout of Praise </i>had just been published.&nbsp; It is a book for people going through hard times.&nbsp; She was going through hard times.&nbsp; I stuffed the book into the fleece-like stocking and took it down to her.&nbsp; I actually rang the doorbell.&nbsp; She came to the door, and I told her: &ldquo;No one should go through Christmas without a gift.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her face turned beet-red and her eyes overflowed.&nbsp; I wanted to hug her but the dog was in her arms and growling at me.&nbsp; I backed off quickly.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know if she would read it or even liked that sort of thing.&nbsp; I hoped and prayed she would find her way to the Truth through it.</p><p>Yesterday, she stopped me outside and said that the poem, <i>Sea of Agony</i> is what got her through the Christmas season.&nbsp; She said she tells everyone she is fine and acts like she has it together, but she admitted she is anything but fine.&nbsp; This truly blessed me because this is the purpose of the book.&nbsp; We talked and I actually found myself liking her.&nbsp; Even the dog let me near without barking.&nbsp; I feel certain that she will find her way to God.&nbsp; I even don&rsquo;t care if she stays living here. In fact, suddenly I started seeing many things about her that were positive.</p><p>This is not a testimony about her changing. It&rsquo;s a testimony about how a 40 year veteran in the Christian faith, who walks closely with the Lord, and who is normally compassionate and loving, can become offended by someone.&nbsp; Hanging onto that offense causes a cancer of dislike and hatefulness to grow.&nbsp; Letting go of it and watching God work, as well as confessing my selfishness and hateful attitude has been a good reminder that no matter how long I am a Christian, I still need Christ to show me my faults and to help me overcome them.&nbsp; I became obedient to Him (although kicking and screaming as I did so), and He forgave me and blessed me with a new friend and a potential sister-in-Christ.&nbsp; I give Him praise.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;Pick up a copy of Cry of Anguish to a Shout of Joy:</p><p><iframe width="320" height="240" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;IS1=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=portlchriscen-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;asins=1449776426" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><hr>||a-personal-story-giving-up-offenses-by-crystal-j-ortmann||||||||http://www.pcctoday.com/monkimage.php?mediaDirectory=mediafiles&mediaId=394168&fileName=header--life-learning--lifeskills-50-50-0-0.jpg~~Join Our Family for Easter Sunday Church Services at 9:00 &amp; 10:45 AM||<img src="http://f049e6c6bc51d6086828-1f3d9bf827f6f62072870f1ea348709c.r40.cf2.rackcdn.com/uploaded/h/0e770397_header--easter-2013.jpg" alt="" />||Celebrate Easter Sunday with us and discover God's love for you at Portland Christian Center, a local SW Portland church.

<h3>How it works:</h3>
<h4>5 minutes a day</h4>
<p>Start with reading 5 minutes a day. This reading plan will take you through all 260 chapters of the New Testament, one chapter per day. The gospels are read throughout the year to keep the story of Jesus fresh all year.</p>
<h4>5 days a week</h4>
<p>Determine a time and location to spend 5 minutes a day for 5 days each week. It is best to have a consistent time and a quiet place where you can regularly meet with the Lord.</p>
<h4>5 ways to dig deeper</h4>
<p>We must pause in our reading to dig into the Bible. Below are five different ways to dig deeper each day. These exercises will encourage meditation. We recommend trying a single idea for a week to find what works best for you. Remember to keep a pen and paper ready to capture God&rsquo;s insights.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Underline or highlight</strong> key words or phrases in the Bible passage. Use a pen or highlighter to mark new discoveries from the text. Periodically review your markings to see what God is teaching you.</li>
<li><strong>Put it into your own words</strong>. Read the passage or verse slowly, then rewrite each phrase or sentence using your own words.</li>
<li><strong>Ask and answer some questions.</strong> Questions unlock new discoveries and meanings. Ask questions about the passage using these words: who, what, why, when, where, or how. Jot down some thoughts on how you would answer these questions.</li>
<li><strong>Capture the big idea.</strong> God&rsquo;s Word communicates big ideas. Periodically ask, <em>What&rsquo;s the big idea in this sentence, paragraph, or chapter?</em></li>
<li><strong>Personalize the meaning.</strong> When God speaks to us through the Scriptures, we must respond. A helpful habit is personalizing the Bible through application. Ask: <em>How could my life be different today as I respond to what I&rsquo;m reading?&nbsp;</em></li>

<h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY: Alexis De Tocqueville</h4>
<i>"The Americans combine the notions of Christianity and liberty so intimately in their minds that it is impossible to make them conceive one without the other."<strong> - A French Politician, Thinker, and Historian (1805 - 1859)</strong></i></blockquote>
<h5>2 Peter 1:3-11</h5>
<p><b>His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by his own glory and goodness...For this reason, make every effort to add to your faith and goodness, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindess, love. But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins...be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall, and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>REFLECT AND DISCUSS</h5>
<p><b>What new efforts do you think you need to make to add to your faith in the coming days, weeks, and months?</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>PRAYER</h5>
<p><i>Your divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness. Through these very great and precious promises we may participate in Your divine nature. Visit Your divine nature upon us and our nation so that we may escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. We desire to make our calling and election sure so we will never fall, and receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. </i></p>
<p><i>Lord Jesus, Come Heal Our Land, so that all men will praise Your Name...Amen</i></p>

<h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY: Jedediah Morse</h4>
<i>"To the kindly influence of Christianity we owe that degree of civil freedom, and political and social happiness which mankind now enjoys...Whenever the pillars of Christianity shall be overthrown, our present republican forms of government, and all blessings which flow from them, must fall with them."<strong>- Graduate of Yale, Pastor, and Creator of the Morse Code</strong></i></blockquote>
<h5>Colossians 1:15-16</h5>
<p><b>He is he image of the invisibile God, the firstborn over all creation. For by him all things were created; things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>REFLECT AND DISCUSS</h5>
<p><b>Do you think there are people in America that are trying to actively overthrow Christianity? How? If they are victorious, what will happen to Christians in the future?</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>PRAYER</h5>
<p><i>We beg You to help us maintain the pillars of Christianity in our nation. Open the eyes of our families and our nation to the fact that all things were created by You and for You.</i></p>

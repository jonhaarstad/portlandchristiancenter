<h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY: Edward Coke</h4>
<i>"The law of nature is that which God at the time of creation of the nature of man infused into his heart, for his preservation and direction...the moral law, called also the law of nature."<strong>- Solicitor General for England &amp; Whales (1592-1594)</strong></i></blockquote>
<h5>Job 38:36</h5>
<p><b>Who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind?</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>REFLECT AND DISCUSS</h5>
<p><b>Some people believe in their hearts that there is no God that created us and that we are all here by accident or chance. How does believing in a God who created us give meaning and purpose to people's lives?</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>PRAYER</h5>
<p><i>Endow our hearts with Your wisdom and give understanding to our minds, the understanding that You are God and Savior. Infuse that understanding and wisdom into our hearts.</i></p>

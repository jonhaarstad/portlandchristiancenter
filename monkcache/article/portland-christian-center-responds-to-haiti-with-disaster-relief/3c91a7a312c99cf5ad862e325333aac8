<h2>Portland Christian Center Responds to Haiti with Disaster Relief!</h2><div id="sermon-info" class="sermon"><ul class="sermon-buttons"></ul><!-- .sermon-buttons --><p class="sermon-meta">Posted Jan 15th, 2010 &nbsp;  </p></div><!-- .sermon --><div id="text"><p><b>In the wake of Haiti&rsquo;s 7.0 earthquake,</b> Portland Christian Center immediately began collecting donations and joining forces with <a target="_blank" href="http://convoyofhope.com/">Convoy of Hope</a>!&nbsp; When the earthquake hit, Convoy&rsquo;s country director was in Port-au-Prince.&nbsp; And because Convoy&rsquo;s warehouse was filly stocked, the Convoy team was able to begin responding immediately with 50,000 meals.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;I heard screams for help from everywhere,&rdquo; said Kevin Rose, Convoy of Hope&rsquo;s country director for Haiti, describing the hours after the earthquake hit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing many dead and injured people. The need is beyond description.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p><a target="_self" href="/haitian-earthquake-relief-donate-today/">More supplies are critically needed and you can be confident every dollar you give through Portland Christian Center will go directly to relief efforts.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The best way to assist the people of Haiti right now,&rdquo; says Hal Donaldson, president of <a target="_blank" href="http://convoyofhope.com/">Convoy of Hope,</a> is by making a cash gift. &ldquo;This is a major disaster that requires a major response. We&rsquo;re encouraging people to join with their family and friends and make a sacrificial gift so more people can receive help. Our pledge is to stretch every dollar to minister to as many suffering people as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our God knows the events of the world before they even happen!&nbsp; As God would have it, Portland Christian Center&rsquo;s Missions Committee had already initiated efforts to host a <a target="_blank" href="http://convoyofhope.com/go/oneday">&ldquo;One Day to Feed the World&rdquo;</a> effort on January 24 and culminating on Easter Sunday.&nbsp; The funds of this effort <b>had already been directed </b>15% to the poor of Portland, Oregon and the balance to Haiti!&nbsp; The Lord had already placed on the hearts of our leadership, and our Convoy of Hope partners, the impoverished country of Haiti!</p>
<p>After initial rescue efforts in Haiti, the real work begins in restoring the country. Because of the extent of damage and estimated loss of life, Portland Christian Center has committed to partner with Convoy of Hope for long-term relief efforts in Haiti, which is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Many of its nearly 10 million residents live in abject poverty.</p>
<p><b>You can be a part of that effort </b>and participate with the Portland Christian Center family in <a target="_blank" href="http://convoyofhope.com/go/oneday">One Day to Feed the World</a>!&nbsp; Stay tuned for more details and how you can participate!</p>
<p>You can be a part of what God is doing around the world!</p>

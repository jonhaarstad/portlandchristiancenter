<h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY: Hudson Taylor</h4>
<i>"If the enemy can destroy the Christian's passion for America, then he has won the major battle for the soul of this nation."<strong> - A British Missionary for China for 51 Years</strong></i></blockquote>
<h5>John 17:20-21</h5>
<p><b>My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as You are in Me and I am in You. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that You have sent me. </b></p>
<h5>John 17:25-26</h5>
<p><b>Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that You have sent me. I have made You known to them, and will continue to make You known in order that the love You have for me may be in them and I myself may be in them. </b></p>

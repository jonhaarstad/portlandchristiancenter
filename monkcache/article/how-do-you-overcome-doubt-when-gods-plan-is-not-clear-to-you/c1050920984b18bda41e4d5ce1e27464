<h2>How Do You Overcome Doubt When God's Plan Is Not Clear To You?</h2><div id="sermon-info" class="sermon"><ul class="sermon-buttons"></ul><!-- .sermon-buttons --><p class="sermon-meta">Posted Sep 6th, 2010 &nbsp;  </p></div><!-- .sermon --><div id="text"><p class="highlight">At the end the message this past Sunday on &ldquo;Unmet Expectations&rdquo;, a sermon on doubt and how to overcome it, someone texted in the question, <i>&ldquo;How do you overcome doubt when God&rsquo;s plan isn&rsquo;t clear to you?&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question..., probably one that is common to us all, and is begging to be answered!&nbsp; My initial response to the question is to affirm the assertion that the path God has called us to walk isn&rsquo;t always clear.&nbsp; Some may feel reluctant to even acknowledge that publically for fear that it belies an ignorance of Scripture&mdash;that any mature believer can find a detailed roadmap for life if they just bother to read the Bible.</p>
<p>Not true! Of course, much of the Bible makes plain God&rsquo;s desire for our attitudes, actions and interactions. In those areas, I suspect that what is required is just simple obedience rather than great amounts of trust (although the two can never truly be separated). Yet in the long-term direction of our lives&mdash;where we are to live, whom we are to marry, what we are to do in our career, how we are to minister as agents of God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;more often than not the way forward is fuzzy.&nbsp; To step out in faith in any of these areas and with any degree of confidence is usually accompanied by nagging doubts.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>So what do you do to overcome your doubts in those instances? Here are a few suggestions:</b></p>
<h4><b>First, go to God and get into his Word.</b></h4>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you would expect a pastor to say, but many people overlook the obvious.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be one of those people. &nbsp;I like how the Message translation renders Proverbs 3:5-6&mdash;a critical piece of advice for this type of question,</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Trust God from the bottom of your heart; don't try to figure out everything on your own. Listen for God's voice in everything you do, everywhere you go;&nbsp;he's the one who will keep you on track. Don't assume that you know it all. Run to God!&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Second, get the counsel of trustworthy, godly and mature believers.</b></h4>
<p>Most of the time they will be able to affirm the direction in which you believe God is leading, or they will be able to see some pitfalls along the away that you don&rsquo;t see&mdash;or don&rsquo;t want to see. Proverbs 11:14 (NKJV) says,</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Where <i>there is</i> no counsel, the people fall; But in the multitude of counselors <i>there is</i> safety.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>And third, just get moving.&nbsp; Lean into God and step out. </b></h4>
<p>Abraham, the father of our faith, heard God&rsquo;s call and just got going without knowing&mdash;and his obedience was credited to him as righteousness.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s how Hebrews 11, God&rsquo;s great Hall of Faith, tells of Abraham&rsquo;s adventure of faith,</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.&rdquo; (Hebrews 11:8)</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, the journey of faith is all about trust. As St Augustine once said, &ldquo;Faith is to believe what we do not see; and the reward of this faith is to see what we believe.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s an old Gospel song that I think is appropriate here,</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>Trust and obey, for there&rsquo;s no other way<br /> To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.</i></h4>
<p>So my friend...as you continue on your spiritual journey to take on the very nature of Christ, please remember you are deeply loved by Him and by me!</p>

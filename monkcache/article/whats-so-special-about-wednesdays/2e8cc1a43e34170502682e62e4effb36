<h2>What's So Special About Wednesdays?</h2><div id="sermon-info" class="sermon"><ul class="sermon-buttons"></ul><!-- .sermon-buttons --><p class="sermon-meta">Posted Aug 27th, 2012 &nbsp;  </p></div><!-- .sermon --><div id="text"><p>Many times, churches are asked the question, "What's so special about Wednesday nights?" Most people understand the purpose of Sunday morning services, as a time to worship God in unity and receive a Word from the Lord through the voice of the Pastor/Speaker (<a href="/services/sunday-celebration-services-old/">More information about the purpose of Sundays please</a>). However, people scratch their heads when the topic of church on any other week night in addition to a Sunday service comes up. They ask, "Isn't Sunday morning enough church for you?"</p>
<p>I recently asked that question myself. After graduating college, getting married, working a full time job for the first time, and finally settling down in a church where we attended regularly on Sundays, I wondered,&nbsp;<strong>"Why would I spend my time at church on a Wednesday night?"</strong> Afterall, my life is busy, in fact it is bursting at the seams with new responsibilities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after about a year of attending church on Sunday mornings, I looked around and realized that I was missing something. I wasn't really a part of the community that I saw around me. I was an outsider getting my 1.5 hours of church attendance checked off my list and then moving onto the next item.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This Summer</strong>, I decided to change my approach to church and become a part of the church community at Portland Christian Center. My husband and I tried a <a href="/get-connected/high-school/connect-with-people/">young married small group</a>, we volunteered on the <a href="/ministries/music-and-worship/worship-band/">worship team</a>, and lately I began attending a Wednesday night class, <a href="/leadership/">Transformational Leadership</a>.</p>
<p>Through the <strong>Wednesday night gathering</strong> I found that I was growing in my relationship with God more steadily through the Biblical teaching. In class, I was learning how to be a leader in my job, how to communicate with my husband in a loving way, and how to better understand myself as a part of God's family. I was able to look up from my notes and connect with others through discussion. I learned their names, their jobs, their likes and dislikes. I finally felt like I was not just attending church, but was becoming a part of my church family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on Sundays, I can glance up and say "Hi" to Karen&mdash;my new friend from class&mdash;and ask her about her week; I can receive a compliment from my new friend Cheryl on my outfit; and I begin to feel like my church is the community I wanted all along. Moving into the Fall, I have the opportunity to start a new class. There are a lot to choose from! I will be taking <a href="/ministries/adult-education/love-and-logic-parenting-classes/becoming-love-and-logic-parent/">Becoming a Love and Logic Parent</a> and have great expectations that I will continue meeting new friends. Hopefully you will find a class/group/choir/volunteer opportunity that helps you connect with your church family. Maybe we can meet and get to know one another on a Wednesday night.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Wednesday Nights at Portland Christian Center</h2>
<p>Joining together midweek for <strong>Wednesday night classes and groups</strong> promotes unity with the church family, develops friendships for children, youth, and adults alike, and gives us <strong>a chance to be discipled outside of a collective Sunday gathering</strong>. We encourage you to invest your time in Wednesday nights. If you are having trouble making <strong>lasting connections with other</strong>s at church, join a class or choir, volunteer with your child in a club, or just come and eat a meal at 5:00 PM. Wednesday nights were created to help you understand a core reason the church exists: <strong>community</strong>.</p>

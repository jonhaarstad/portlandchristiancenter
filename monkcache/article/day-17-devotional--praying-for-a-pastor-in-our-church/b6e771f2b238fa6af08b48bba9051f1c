<h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY: James Madison</h4>
<i>"We've staked our future on our ability to follow the Ten Commandments with all of our heart."<strong>- Fourth President of the United States (1809-1817)</strong></i></blockquote>
<h5>Proverbs 4:20-23</h5>
<p><b>My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body. Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>REFLECT AND DISCUSS</h5>
<p><b>Are you paying attention to God's Word? If yes, how are you doing this ? If no, what are things that are distracting you from God's Word?</b></p>
<hr />
<h5>PRAYER</h5>
<p><i>Your commandments are under attack not only in our nation but around the world. Write those commandments on our hearts. Bring them back to us and to the minds of our countrymen so that we will be a wellspring of Your love and life.</i></p>

<h2 class="n">Planning for Your First Visit</h2>
<h4>First of all, please know we are happy to have you!</h4>
<p>Our church campus, and groups in homes across the Portland metro area, are alive with ministry all week long&mdash;full of gatherings for kids, teens and adults. And whether it's an event, a weekend service, or another type of ministry, it's done with a common purpose at the core: to bridge people to God through a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.&nbsp;Whether you are curious or seriously seeking a "church home,&rdquo; you are very much welcome at Portland Christian Center!&nbsp;<span>.</span></p>
<h4>Here are a few tips to make your first visit more comfortable.</h4>
<p style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="list_001">
<li class="li_one"><span class="li_title">Worship Service Time</span><br />We meet together on Sunday mornings for two life-giving worship services at <a href="/services/">9:00 AM and 10:45 AM. </a>Our services include a time of music followed by a lesson/sermon by our lead pastor, <a href="/about/meet-our-pastors-and-staff/">Pastor Ray Noah.</a> On your first visit, it&rsquo;s best to arrive a few minutes early, or about 15 minutes early if you need time to find your children&rsquo;s classroom locations. Children are important to us and we typically always offer age appropriate activities at all of our events. We would also like to invite you to enjoy our 9:00 AM&nbsp;<strong>Learning Hour </strong>that includes classes and programs available not only for children, but youth and adults. <a href="http://www.parentingchildrenwithhealthissues.com/index.html">Life Learning activities are also available throughout the week.</a></li>
<li class="li_two"><span class="li_title">Arrive and Get Parked</span><br /> We are a single-campus church with one location, and plenty of parking. Don't hesitate to ask for help from our parking team (the ones wearing bright vests). They'll help you navigate the lots, which can get crowded before both services. Arriving 15 minutes before the services start will make things easier. Shuttles run continuously and we even have overflow parking available in the Neveh Shalom parking lot. If you are in overflow parking our safe drivers will drop you off right at the front door and be there to pick you up again after the service.</li>
<li class="li_three"><span class="li_title">Find a Place for Yourself and Your Kids</span><br /> Information Center volunteers and greeters are ready to answer your questions before, between, and after the service. Just look for them behind the counters, in the foyer, and at every door. They can help you choose an adult class that&rsquo;s right for you. If you have children, stop by the information booth to find out about <a href="/ministries/children/" target="_blank">Adventure Kids</a> and our professional nursery that is available during BOTH Sunday Celebration Services. <a href="/revolution/" target="_blank">Middle School students</a> meet at 9:00 AM in the Fireside Room and <a href="/unveiled/">High School students</a> also meet at 9:00 AM in the Youth Center.</li>
<li class="li_four"><span class="li_title">Celebrate Through Worship</span><br /> Greeters will welcome you into the Worship Center and give you a program outlining the service. Ushers can help you find a seat. Toward the beginning of the service, everyone is invited to stand and greet one another with handshakes. You will not be singled out as a visitor. Biblical teaching, prayer, giving, and regularly-scheduled communion services are key components of worship at Portland Christian Center. Feel free to join into the worship experience as you are comfortable.</li>
<li class="li_five"><span class="li_title">Let Us Help You</span><br /> If you would like to talk about a personal concern or something you heard in the service, look for one of our Pastors. They are available at every service. Members of the Prayer Team are also helpful. These men and women have been trained to listen, encourage, and they are eager to help. They also can pray with you.&nbsp;</li>

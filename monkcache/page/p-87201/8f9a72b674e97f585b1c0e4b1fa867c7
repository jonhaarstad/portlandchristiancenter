<h2 class="n">Student Choirs</h2>
<p>Our Student Choirs gives opportunity for Middle School and High School students to be involved in a dynamic Worship Ministry. These Choirs provide a great experience for students in the areas of worship and service. The purpose of these groups can be summed up in 4 words: <b>&ldquo;Worship God / Serve Others&rdquo;.</b></p>

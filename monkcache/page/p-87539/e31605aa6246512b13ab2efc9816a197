<h2 class="n">Student Leadership</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Student Leadership is a year-long commitment to SERVANT LEADERSHIP in Revolution Middle School Ministries. We'll invest in you as you grow to be the leader God's called you to be.</p>
<h3>Who can be in it?</h3>
<p>Students in 6th-8th grade may apply. And it's important to remember that you're applying to become a servant not a SUPER STAR</p>
<h3>Your Commitment:</h3>
<p>It's a big commitment: We have monthly meetings during the year.&nbsp;You'll serve on an SMT (Student Ministry Team). You'll be challenged to grow, talk to people about Jesus, and be accountable to another person.</p>
<p>We'll expect you to live an above reproach lifestyle:<br />LOVING GOD, LOVING PEOPLE, SERVING THE WORLD.</p>
<h3>Our Commitment:</h3>
<p>We will equip you to live as a Christian student/leader on your campus. We'll give you the tools and guidance needed to lead others and influence them to follow Jesus.</p>

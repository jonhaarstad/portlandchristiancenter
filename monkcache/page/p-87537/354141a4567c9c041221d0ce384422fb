<h2>Community Service Projects</h2>
<p class="highlight">Revolution participates in several community service projects throughout the year. Some of our regular events include:</p>
<h3>Robert Gray Clean Up Day</h3>
<p>Each year our entire church joins with our local neighborhood and spends a few hours cleaning and refurbishing the school grounds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great family event and a great way to show the community that we care. This event happens annually at the end of August.</p>
<h3>Rake-N-Run</h3>
<p>Rake-N-Run is a fun serving opportunity in the Fall where we drive through our community and rake as many yards as possible leaving a note at each house to let them know that we care and so does God. This event happens annually in November.</p>
<h3>Oregon&nbsp;Food Bank</h3>
<p>We help the poor and needy in our community by volunteering at the Action Center of the Oregon Food Bank. We&rsquo;re able to repack bulk food like rice, pasta or beans; sort canned food and get packages put together. This event happens annually in February.</p>

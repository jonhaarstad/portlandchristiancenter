<h2 class="n">Biblical Counseling</h2>
<h3>Pastoral Counseling</h3>
<p>Our Pastoral Team gives counsel from the Scriptures, helping people learn how principles from God's Word may be applied to related situations in their lives. By understanding and applying the Scriptures to problems in everyday life, people are empowered with God's perfect will for their life. Our Congregational Life Ministries sees to it that a pastor is available 24/7 for emergencies. If you have a need to speak with a pastor, call the office at (503) 245-7735.</p>
<p>Many times, issues can be addressed with Pastoral Care staff while others times we may suggest referral to counselors who specialize in psychological and personality issues. We work with a group of counselors who support values and methodology that we believe.</p>
<h3>Pre-Marital Counseling</h3>
<p>Our Pastoral Counselors are trained and certified in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prepare-enrich.com/">PREPARE/ENRICH Program</a>. This widely know counseling program is used for premarital counseling, marriage preparation, and marriage enrichment. &nbsp;PREPARE/ENRICH includes a comprehensive couple assessment along with feedback using skills building exercises.</p>
<p>At least four sessions of pre-marital counseling is required in order to be married at Portland Christian Center and/or by one of our pastors. Some couples counsel for as many as eight to ten sessions, as needed.&nbsp; Couples focus on 11 different areas of a successful marriage and receive personality diagnostics, personalized feedback, budgeting tips, and more.&nbsp; Couples receive a one-on-one consultation to discuss the length of counseling recommended.</p>
<p><strong>The counseling itself is free; however, we ask couples to pay for assessments and materials for $100.00.</strong> This will include the PREPARE/ENRICH diagnostic tool, workbook, and a marriage book/tool recommended by your Pastoral Counselor.</p>
<p>You may select the Pastoral Counselor you feel most comfortable with as they all engage in the same tools and process.&nbsp; Certified counselors include Pastors <a target="_blank" href="mailto:jslater@pcctoday.com">Joel Slater</a>, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:lnoah@pcctoday.com">Linda Noah</a>, <script type='text/javascript'>var u1221787007='cbryant'; var h1485147898='pcctoday.com';var linktext='Caleb Bryant</a> and lay counselors <a target="_blank" href="mailto:davidk@digitypedesign.com">David and Deborah Kaiser.';h1485147898='pcctoday.com';document.write('<a href=' + 'mail' + 'to:' + u1221787007 + '@' + h1485147898 + '>' + linktext + '</a>');

<h3>Community Life is an important part of your growth as a Christian.</h3>
<p>At Portland Christian Center we would encourage you to expand your Sunday morning experience by participating in a class, small group, or mentoring relationship. In addition to the type of group experience you can select, you can also select a venue: class on campus, home group, restaurant or office setting.</p>
<h4>How long does each group meeting last?</h4>
<p>Each Community Life Group picks the length of time they will meet. However, most groups meet for an hour and a half to two hours. You can read in the group description if the group is ongoing or only offered for a limited number of weeks.</p>
<h4>What goes on at a group meeting?</h4>
<p>Though each group differs in how they do things, many groups have a social time in the beginning, then they transition to a time where they discuss the book, topic or activity they are studying and pray for each other. Groups form for lots of reasons; as a place to belong, grow, serve, reach out, and/or worship. Whatever group is formed the foundation of that group is to provide an atmosphere for the participant&rsquo;s to grow in Christ.</p>
<h4>What does it mean when a group "ends" or "multiplies"?</h4>
<p>During the term of the group, the group leader will train an apprentice to be the leader of the next group. At the end of the group, the leader will take half the current group, and the apprentice (after becoming an approved leader) will take the other half of the group. Then they will both add more members to their respective new groups, therefore allowing others to join groups with seasoned leaders.</p>
<h4>What do groups study?</h4>
<p>Each group picks their own curriculum to study with the help of the Pastor that has oversight of your particular group. Because group life is such an important part of our spiritual growth each Pastor is encouraged to form smaller groups within their ministries. All of our Pastors function under the same group model, but with independent purposes and/or affinity groups.</p>
<h4>Are Community Life Groups always bible studies?</h4>
<p>Not necessarily. Sometimes Community Life Groups are Backyard BBQs, prayer groups, affinity groups that center around a variety of interests, etc.. We do encourage all groups to include, as much as possible, the purposes of a Spirit-formed church found in Acts 2. This would include elements of Belonging, Growing, Serving, Reaching, and Worship.</p>
<h4>How do I join a community life group?</h4>

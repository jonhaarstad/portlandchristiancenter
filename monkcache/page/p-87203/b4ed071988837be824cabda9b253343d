<h2 class="n">Kids Music</h2>
<p class="highlight">Lifelong worship begins as a child. Our Kids' Choirs teach children basic music concepts, but more than that, they teach them the truths of God&rsquo;s Word through the music they learn and perform.</p>
<h3>Age 3-5 years old<br /> Tiny Tunes</h3>
<p>Our Pre-school Choir (Ages 3-5) meets each Sunday morning throughout the year. They perform 3 times per year (Mother&rsquo;s Day, Kid&rsquo;s Spring Concert, and Christmas).</p>

<h3>Elementary (1st &ndash; 5th Grade)<br /> Kids Praise Company!</h3>
<p>Kids Praise Company is a fantastic group of fun, talented and very enthusiastic 1st through 5th Graders! Each Spring, we have a blast putting on a full musical production complete with cool props, professional lighting, choreography, drama and, of course, a whole lot of amazing music!&nbsp;<span>They are also featured in Portland&rsquo;s Christmas Celebration concerts every December.</span></p>
<p>Your child and all of their friends are guaranteed an unforgettable time!</p>
<p><strong>Registration for the Fall/Winter season will begin in September.</strong></p>

<h3>Hospital &amp; Home Visits</h3>
<p>No one looks forward to hospital stays, periods of rehabilitation, or extended care. Anxiety often accompanies hospitalizations, and extended care can cause isolation from family, friends, and the church community. Portland Christian Center pastors and caring volunteers seek to lift these burdens by visiting and praying with our church family in the hospital or extended care.&nbsp; There are two ways to request and/or notify us of the need for a hospital visit:</p>

</script> ] at 503.245.7735 x257, our pastor in charge of pastoral hospital or extended care visits.&nbsp; Please provide the person&rsquo;s name, their hospital or care facility, and the dates they are expected to be there.</li>

<h2>Serve In Our Community</h2>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Matthew 5:16</blockquote>
<h3>Serve the City</h3>
<ul>
<li>&hellip;A lifestyle and not an event</li>
<li>&hellip;A culture and not a program</li>
<li>&hellip;A way of being His Church as we serve our neighbors in need</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community-Wide Outreaches</h2>
<h3>Love Where You Live</h3>
<p>September 28, 2013</p>
<p>Acts 17:26&hellip;..and He marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands&hellip;.<br />Come and be a part of this community outreach as we extend our hands, our hearts and our resources into various areas of service around Portland Christian Center. We will be serving in small groups on this Saturday morning, starting with muffins, caffeine and t-shirts at 9am as we connect with our groups in the gym. At 9:15 we head to our specific locations, to give a bit of redemptive lift to our own city and to enjoy getting to know the people in our group as well. At 11:30 we jump back into our carpools and head to PCC for a free celebration lunch and to hear of the various adventures that have taken place. Ministry sites to be listed soon. Keep checking back.</p>

<h3>Portland&rsquo;s Christmas Celebration:&nbsp;A Concert</h3>
<p>This annual musical production is presented to our community free of charge and features over 400 musicians and singers, including adult choir, live orchestra, children&rsquo;s choir, youth choirs and handbells. It is truly a highlight of our community&rsquo;s holiday season! But it takes a herculean effort to pull off an event this huge! Opportunities to serve at this event range from singers and musicians, to cuddling babies in the nursery, to helping in the kitchen, decorating the foyer, or assisting on the greeting or parking crews.</p>

<h3><a href="/community-care-day/">Community Care Day</a></h3>
<p>Join friends, school employees and neighbors for our annual Community Care Day each August. This three-hour volunteer work party meets at neighboring schools and prepares the grounds and landscaping for the beginning of the school year. It&rsquo;s truly amazing what we can do in such a short time. [ <a href="/community-care-day/">more information</a> ]<strong></strong></p>

<h3>Neighborhood Repair and Building Projects</h3>
<p>One of the unseen ministries of the church, but hugely appreciated is when a group of men and women invest time in repairs or upkeep on a home for someone who can&rsquo;t physically or financially afford to do the work themselves. When possible a team of volunteers will help repair front steps, maybe replace a fence, or simply clean up overgrown landscaping.</p>

<h3>Neighborhood House &ndash; Multnomah</h3>
<p>A strategic partnership with <a href="http://www.nhpdx.org/" target="_blank">Neighborhood House</a> has allowed the church to help the hungry, and sometimes homeless, in the Multnomah/Hillsdale neighborhoods. Throughout the year we help financially to purchase food and supplies. During the year we also collect food to help restock empty shelves. And Neighborhood House can always find a job for the willing volunteer. Whether it&rsquo;s giving a financial gift, or volunteering your time, you will be making a difference in our own backyard.</p>

<h3>Teen Challenge Drug and Dependency Program</h3>
<p>We believe that there is hope for recovery for every individual who is bound with life controlling problems such as addiction to drugs or alcohol by establishing a relationship with Jesus Christ. We believe there is hope even when everyone else says "just give up." <a href="http://www.teenchallengepnw.com/" target="_blank">Teen Challenge</a> offers a safe place for recovery based on Biblical principles to eligible individuals, regardless of their ability to pay. Portland Christian Center has maintained a strategic relationship with Teen Challenge in order to assist them in helping men and women in the Portland area. Our involvement involves financial support, mentoring, and including Teen Challenge students in our ministry when possible.</p>

<h2>Children's Needs</h2>
<h3>Preemie Project:</h3>
<p>This is an opportunity for anyone to knit or crochet hats for premature babies born at Doernbecher Hospital. Approximately 50 hats are distributed each month. Building bridges to the parents of premature babies is important. Often these relationships lead to lasting friendships and spiritual change. And most importantly, each preemie hat is a gift of love bringing spiritual and physical warmth to these tiny babies.</p>

<h2>Youth in our Community</h2>
<h3>Dinner And A Movie: Homeless Youth</h3>

<h3>Rake &lsquo;N&rsquo; Run Middle School Outreach:</h3>
<p>This is a service project our middle school students do every fall to help others. They arrive at a neighbor's house, rake the leaves quickly and thoroughly...and then "leaf". They don't do it for money or recognition; they do it for FREE to show God&rsquo;s love!</p>

<h3>Witness Missions Tour for Middle School Students<br />Priority Missions Tour for High School and College Students</h3>

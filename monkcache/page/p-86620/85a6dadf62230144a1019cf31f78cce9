<h2>About Us - Who We Are</h2>
<h3 class="highlight">Portland Christian Center wants to make a lasting difference in your <a href="#Life">life</a>, your&nbsp;<a href="#family">family</a>, our <a href="#community">community</a>, and <a href="#community">the world</a>.</h3>
<p class="highlight">How do we go about that? &nbsp;By BRIDGING you from where you are today in your spiritual walk to becoming a fully devoted follower of Christ.&nbsp;That's the driving purpose behind everything we do, and we&rsquo;re passionate about it!</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="blue"><a id="Life"></a>In Your Life...</h3>
<p>We want to help you get to know God better and enable you to become who He's created you to be. No matter where you are in life, we'll help you figure out some next steps in your journey with Him. It could start with <a href="/outreach/">serving</a>, participating in a <a href="/ministries/life-learning/summer/">class or small group</a>, <a href="/giving/">giving</a>, or <a href="/services/">attending church regularly.</a></p>
<p>Joining a <a href="/ministries/life-learning/summer/">small group or class</a> can help you grow closer to God while building relationships with other people. Having a strong community of friends to laugh, grow, and serve with will make a lasting difference in your life.</p>
<p>Along the way, we hope to work with you to make the world a better place by spreading the love of God throughout the world. God can use <a href="/connect-experience/">your gifts and skills</a> to change lives by <a href="/outreach/serve-within-the-church/">serving at Portland Christian Center</a>. You can also make a difference through <a href="/outreach/">missions</a> in <a href="/serve/serving-locally/">our local communities</a> and <a href="/serve/serving-globally/">around the globe</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="blue"><a id="family"></a>For Your Family...</h3>
<p>We believe strong families start with a solid foundation. We <a href="/love-and-logic/">partner with parents</a> to help raise up the next generation to have a strong relationship with Jesus. There are <a href="/ministries/children/">opportunities throughout the week for children</a>, <a href="/revolution/">middle school</a> and <a href="/revolution/">high school</a> teens to grow closer to each other and to God. We also invest a lot of time and energy into <a href="/lifelearning/marriage/">supporting strong marriages</a> and the issues that are relevant to the growing family.</p>

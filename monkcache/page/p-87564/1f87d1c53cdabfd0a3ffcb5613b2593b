<h2 class="n">Music and Worship Ministries</h2>
<p class="highlight">Music is a language that communicates the joy and hope of the Christian life! It's an expression of our worship and devotion to God.</p>
<p>The Music Ministry of Portland Christian Center, located in Portland, OR is a ministry of worship. The Bible says that we are to "make His praise glorious," so we endeavor to offer God our finest sacrifice of praise.</p>

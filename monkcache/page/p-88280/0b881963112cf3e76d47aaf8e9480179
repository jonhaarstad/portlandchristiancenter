<h2 class="n">Active Adults - 55+</h2>
<p class="highlight">We are an active group of people over 55 who enjoy monthly and year-round activities that foster community and discipleship. We are located in Portland, Oregon.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
<p>Each month a special activity is planned for our Active Adults (ages 55 and up). From a day trip to the coast, to fun and fellowship luncheons, picnics or an evening of soup and hymn singing, we have a diverse array of activities planned for the whole year! If you are interested in learning more about this group or signing up for an event, please call our church office (503) 245-7735 and ask for Tana Hines or visit the table in the lobby on Sunday mornings.&nbsp;</p>

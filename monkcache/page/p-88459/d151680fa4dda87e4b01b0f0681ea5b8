<h2 class="n">Mentoring &amp; Coaching</h2>
<h4>What is a mentor?</h4>
<p><strong>A mentor is&hellip;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A model</li>
<li>An encourager</li>
<li>An imparter of knowledge</li>
<li>All of the above</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The answer is "d".</strong> A mentor may wear many different hats but the one thing that all mentors share is the ability to listen and encourage. A mentor is &ldquo;a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction,&rdquo; according to the Uncommon Individual Foundation, an organization devoted to mentoring research and training. It reports that mentoring is one of the most powerful tools we have for influencing human behavior and creating transformation change in our lives.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Among the most important roles mentors play include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Giving timely information to mentorees</li>
<li>Modeling aspects of what they wish to impart</li>
<li>Challenging and motivating mentorees to move to higher levels</li>
<li>Directing mentorees to helpful resources when needed (sometimes painfully so)</li>
<li>Encouraging goodness and inspiring greatness</li>
<li>Lessening mentorees&rsquo; anxiety by normalizing experiences</li>
<li>Helping mentorees set goals</li>
<li>Keeping mentorees accountable to their goals</li>
<li>Providing a periodic review and evaluation of mentorees&rsquo; performance</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be an intimidating list, however, <b>two dynamics are vital to the success of any mentoring relationship.</b> Without them, all the modeling, challenging, encouraging, goal-setting, and accountability will fall flat. The two critical dynamics are (1) attraction, and (2) responsiveness.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Attraction is the starting point in every effective mentoring relationship.</b> The mentor and the mentoree must be drawn to each other to some degree. If either side is not genuinely interested in the other, true mentoring will never take place.</li>
<li><b>Responsiveness is the second important factor.</b> Along with the attractiveness, the mentoree must be willing and ready to learn from the mentor. Without a responsive attitude and a receptive spirit on the part of the mentoree, little genuine mentoring can occur.</li>
</ol>
<h4>This is why we take great care and prayer in creating mentor and mentoree relationships.</h4>
<hr />
<h3>What types of mentoring relationships are there?</h3>
<p><b>A:&nbsp; All types.&nbsp; However, we pair up men with men, women with women, and couple to couple.&nbsp; You can engage in a mentoring relationship for a variety of reasons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Marriage and family mentoring</li>
<li>Spiritual development</li>
<li>Life Purpose and significance discussions</li>
<li>Skill development in a variety of areas from cooking, sewing to mechanics, fishing, etc.</li>
<li>Managing grief</li>
<li>Financial planning</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;really the topic isn&rsquo;t the important factor, the relationship is the key!</p>

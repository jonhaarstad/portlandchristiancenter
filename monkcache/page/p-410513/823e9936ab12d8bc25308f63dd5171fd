It is how boys learn and relate best. Because of this Royal Rangers is an activity-based mentoring program, which we believe provides essential ingredients in enabling every boy&rsquo;s healthy spiritual development.&nbsp;Beyond the fun, in Royal Rangers boys build lifelong frienships and discover they have what it takes to be men of faith, integrity, loyalty and courage.</p><h4>Weekly Club Meetings</h4><p>At our weekly Royal Rangers club meetings, the boys build a sense of belonging, discipline and commitment as they advance through the stages of the program. They wear uniforms, learn new skills, earn merit badges, and learn to put their Bible lessons into practice.&nbsp;The boys are honored annually for their achievements in a special Award and Recognition Ceremony.</p><h4>Special Events</h4><p>Our Royal Rangers also have many opportunities to participate in exciting special events throughout the year such as:</p><ul><ul><li>Class Outings - including hikes, boating trips and more&nbsp;</li><li>Campouts - both small and large</li><li>Pinewood Derby - a building project and racing event</li></ul></ul><p>If you questions about Royal Rangers, contact Pastor Phil at <script type='text/javascript'>var u659941871='phahn'; var h254365435='pcctoday.com';var linktext=u659941871+'@'+h254365435;h254365435='pcctoday.com';document.write('<a href=' + 'mail' + 'to:' + u659941871 + '@' + h254365435 + '>' + linktext + '</a>');

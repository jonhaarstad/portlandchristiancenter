<h2 class="n">A2 <br /><span>Young Adults</span></h2>
<blockquote>A2 is a great opportunity for young adults (18-30): college-age, young professional, single or married, to grow and connect with people and with God in refreshingly authentic community in Portland, Oregon.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<h3>Welcome to A2 - A Biblical Community for Young Adults</h3>
<h4>What do we mean by that?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The philosophy behind A2 is based on the passage of Scripture found in Acts 2:42-47 where the first church community is described: this community was&nbsp;<i>devoted to God, committed to one another,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>dedicated to welcoming others&nbsp;</i>into the community of God&rsquo;s people<i>.</i>&nbsp;In A2, you will find these same values lived out in simple, fun, and authentic ways.</p>
<h4>What does A2 look like?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>A2 is all about sharing life together. It is built around community groups, meeting together in homes from 7-8:30pm on Friday nights to hang out, share some light food, have a brief, Bible-based discussion time, and then hang out some more! You can expect to be greeted at the door and welcomed into a comfortable, lightly-structured time of meeting people, having fun, and listening in or sharing your thoughts on a relevant, Biblical topic.</p>
<p>Also, once a month, fun events are planned and include activities such as: bowling, dinner &amp; a movie, game night, flag football, etc. This is a great time to invite friends and enjoy a fun night together as a community.&nbsp;</p>

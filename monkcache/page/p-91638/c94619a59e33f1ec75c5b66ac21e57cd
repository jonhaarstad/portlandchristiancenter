<h3>The vision of a Side-by-Side ministry is:</h3>
<ul class="boxed">
<li>To connect a woman who is more mature in the Christian walk with a woman who is younger in her walk. Through sharing together in their relationship both will benefit.</li>
<li>To give young women the opportunity to hear and be encouraged by an older woman&rsquo;s godly perspective on life.</li>
<li>To give older women the opportunity to respond to God&rsquo;s call to come along side younger women.</li>
</ul>
<h4>This is based on the principles found in verses such as:</h4>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips, not enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, that the Word of God may not be dishonored.&rdquo; - Titus 2:3-5<br /><br />"Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.&rdquo; -&nbsp;1 Corinthians 11:1</blockquote>
<h3>What is a mentoring relationship?</h3>
<h4>Side-by-Side mentoring can focus on a variety of areas:</h4>
<p>Marriage, Parenting, Career, Spiritual Development, Skill Development, Time Management, Domestic Skills, ...the list is endless!</p>

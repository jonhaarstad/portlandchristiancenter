<p><strong>In order to consider the unique learning styles of each child,</strong> we make sure our early education program consists of both indoor and outdoor activities, alternating active and quiet play, and a balance of child-directed and teacher-directed learning time. One of the elements that makes Hilltop unique is our developmentally appropriate curriculum to meet the individual needs of each child. Our staff accomplishes this with a balance of child/teacher&ndash;directed learning times, a hands&ndash;on approach to learning especially with our Foss Science Program and Christian faith &amp; values. You can see <a href="/get-connected/hilltop-preschool--kindergarten/classroom/" target="_blank"><em>Inside the Classroom</em></a>&nbsp;and even view our <a href="/ministries/hilltop-preschool-and-kindergarten/hilltop-enrichment-programs/" target="_blank"><em>Enrichment Programs</em>&nbsp;right</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We hire only the best at HILLTOP Preschool &amp; Kindergarten.</strong>&nbsp; <a href="/ministries/hilltop-preschool-and-kindergarten/hilltop-teaching-team/">You can meet our teaching team right here</a>. Our staff has gone through a rigorous interview and background check process, completed infant/child CPR and first aid training, receive ongoing child development training, and are Oregon State Certified. All of our teachers are equipped with the necessary early childhood education, which meets or exceeds requirements set forth by HILLTOP Preschool &amp; Kindergarten and the State of Oregon to fulfill the special role of teaching and caring for young children.&nbsp; But, we don't just stop there, because a licence, certificate or degree does not guarantee a great teacher.&nbsp; Our teaching staff must also demonstrate a loving and nurturing heart AND a "call" to work with young children. We take pride in our teachers understanding the special nuances of Love and Logic for classroom management and the developmental needs of your child.</p>
<p><strong>The entire staff at HILLTOP Preschool &amp; Kindergarten considers it a joy and a privilege to participate in the development of the young children entrusted to us.</strong>&nbsp;We are a ministry of Portland Christian Center and have the full backing of the church, it's Pastoral staff and support teams as we aim to support you and your child. We look forward to sharing all that God has planned for your family at HILLTOP Preschool &amp; Kindergarten.</p>

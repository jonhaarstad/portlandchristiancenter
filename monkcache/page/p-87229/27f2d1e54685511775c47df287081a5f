<p>We believe that our call to be a Biblical church is one that is intentionally focused on Jesus and aligned with his definition of what his church is to be. Through his teaching, Jesus provided a clear definition for the purpose and mission of the church that is well summarized in his &ldquo;Great Commandment&rdquo; to love God, and love others, and in his &ldquo;Great Commission&rdquo; to make disciples of all people, baptize them into God&rsquo;s family, and teach them how to live according to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In response to Jesus&rsquo; defining call, his followers established the original New Testament church 2000 years ago at Pentecost (described in Acts 2). His original design for church is just as important today as it was then. As a result, Jesus unmistakable instructions give Portland Christian Center a clear direction for daily life and a driving purpose for each and all of our ministries as we become a Spirit-formed church.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="highlight"><b>Five Elements of a Spirit-formed church:&nbsp; Acts 2:42-47.</b></p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<h3>BELONGING</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;They devoted themselves to the fellowship to the breaking of bread&hellip;everyday they continued to meet together in the temple courts&hellip;they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>You are adopted into God's family when you belong to Jesus.&nbsp; Once you decide to belong to your church family, you enjoy the benefits of loving support, encouragement, and healthy environments in which to grow spiritually.</p>
<p class="highlight">As a church, we grow &ldquo;warmer&rdquo; through belonging.</p>
<hr />
<h3>GROWING</h3>
<blockquote>They devoted themselves to the apostles&rsquo; teaching&hellip;and to prayer&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Once you belong, it is important to continue with an intentional process of growth - spiritual maturity is no accident. Healthy biblical teaching and spiritual practices improve your relationship with God and with others.&nbsp; Learning about God, and cultivating your intimacy with Him is a lifetime endeavor that brings you to maturity, balance, and joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;We offer opportunities to grow in a Christian Worldview in your Personal Life, Family Life, Work Life, Community Life, and Spiritual Life.</p>
<p class="highlight">As Christ followers, we become &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; by growing.</p>

<h3>SERVING</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had a need&hellip;&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>God gave you unique gifts that He intends for you to use to help and love others.&nbsp; We are all built for service, and Jesus is our ultimate example of gifted serving.&nbsp; Discovering your unique design (or SHAPE) for serving is a key step in understanding God&rsquo;s will for your life and for experience a life of success, significance and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="highlight">As a church, we become more &ldquo;loving&rdquo; by serving.</p>
<hr />
<h3>REACHING</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>A healthy loving family always shares its blessings with others.&nbsp; The good news of God's unconditional love is best demonstrated by reaching out to invite others into the knowledge of God's great love for them, at home, in our community and to the farthest reaches of the planet.</p>
<p class="highlight">Our church family becomes &ldquo;broader&rdquo; by reaching.</p>

<h3>WORSHIPPING</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Everyone was filled with awe&hellip;&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Worshiping God in every facet of our lives give us joy, health, and balance.&nbsp; An abundant life is one filled with gratitude to God, and balances all five of God's purposes of Belonging, Growing, Serving, Reaching, and Worshiping God in a dynamic life lived in the center of God's will.&nbsp; Keeping God in his rightful place in our lives allows us to respond to His profound love for us.</p>
<p class="highlight">Together, we become &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; by worshipping.</p>

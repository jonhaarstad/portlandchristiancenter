<h2 class="n">Serve Within The Church</h2>
<p>As Christians, we are all invited to follow Christ&rsquo;s example of serving others. One of the ways you can participate in that calling is by finding a place to volunteer at Portland Christian Center. Not only will you be giving your time in service to others, but this will also give you a chance to meet and explore new friendships with those you will be serving alongside.</p>

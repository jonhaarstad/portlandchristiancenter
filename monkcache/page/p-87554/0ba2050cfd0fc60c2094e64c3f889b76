<h2>Unveiled <br />High School</h2>
<p class="highlight">We are a group of high schoolers who are passionate about discovering who we are, who God is, and what this life is all about.</p>
<h3 class="unveiled_header">Our Mission...</h3>
<p>To help students&nbsp;experience God through relationships and weekly gatherings with other students and adult leaders so they can enter their adult lives knowing who they are, who God is, and what life is all about.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="unveiled_header">What's With the Name?</h3>
<p>The name "Unveiled" comes from a passage found in 2 Corinthians 3:16-18, which says:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into His likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."</blockquote>
<p>That's when the adventure of living for God begins! So come check out what's going on at Unveiled.</p>

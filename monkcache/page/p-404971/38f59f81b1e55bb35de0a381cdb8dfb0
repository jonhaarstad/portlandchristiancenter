<p>This is a time to connect with other women, to meet new friends, to accomplish something creative or to just sit and chat.&nbsp; Bring a current project that you&rsquo;re working on and have an uninterrupted evening to complete it (or make progress J).&nbsp; Everyone is encouraged to bring a little snack to share AND a friend.&nbsp; Some of the projects that the ladies&nbsp;bring to work on are:&nbsp; knitting, quilting, scrapbooking, sewing&hellip;..even&nbsp;bookkeeping.&nbsp; Twice a year we do a marathon from 3pm on a Friday evening to 1pm on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; Sleep is optional.</p>

<h3>Senior Widows Invited For Tea (S.W.I.F.T.)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>An afternoon set aside to bless and encourage those who have lost their spouses.&nbsp; The book of James tells us that &ldquo;religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress&hellip;&hellip;. &nbsp;This is an opportunity to do just that, for those in our congregation.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you join us?</p>

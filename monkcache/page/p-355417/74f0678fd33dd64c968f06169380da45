They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.&rdquo; -Acts 2:44-47 (NIV)</em></p></blockquote><p>God is into community&mdash;big time! In fact, you cannot be an authentic God-follower without getting that the vitality of your walk with Him is commensurate with your connectedness with His family. Using both Old and New Testament examples of how the Jews were shaped into God&rsquo;s people and how the followers of Jesus were transformed into the New Community, this series will help you to discover the exponential energy of community unleashed in your life and through your church to impact your world.</p><p>We also have activities for <a href="/ministries/children/">kids</a>, <a href="/revolution/">middle school</a> and <a href="/unveiled/">high school</a>&nbsp;at our 9:00 AM and 10:45 AM services.</p><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr class="tbl_header"><td>DATE</td><td>COMMUNITY SERIES</td><td>SPEAKER</td></tr><tr><td>September 1</td><td>The Unleashed Energy of One&nbsp;</td><td>Pastor Ray Noah</td></tr><tr><td>September 8</td><td>Buying into the Mission&nbsp;</td><td>Chevian Breedt</td></tr><tr><td>September 15</td><td>Why Church?</td><td>Pastor Ray Noah</td></tr><tr><td>September 29</td><td>Allelous</td><td>Pastor Ray Noah</td></tr><tr><td>October 6</td><td>Radical</td><td>Pastor Ray Noah</td></tr></tbody></table>

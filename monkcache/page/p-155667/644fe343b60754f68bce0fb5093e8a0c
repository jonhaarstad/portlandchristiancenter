The Bible is a handbook on service. The word "servant," or its derivatives ("servants," "serve"), appears a little over one thousand times in the Scriptures.</p><p>The range to which Christians are called to serve is as wide and unique to the individual believer's giftedness and field of ministry as there are gifts and needs.</p><blockquote>&ldquo;For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&rdquo; <strong>Ephesians 2:10</strong></blockquote><h4>Leadership:</h4><ul class="list_005"><li><script type='text/javascript'>var u1837476122='bward'; var h1687012430='pcctoday.com';var linktext='Bob Ward - Missions Pastor';h1687012430='pcctoday.com';document.write('<a href=' + 'mail' + 'to:' + u1837476122 + '@' + h1687012430 + '>' + linktext + '</a>');

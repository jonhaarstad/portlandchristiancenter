Your child or teen will find that our teachers can help them grow quickly, while keeping them interested and having fun!</p><p>If you child has a special song request or loves a partciular genre of music, our teachers are happy to encorporate that into their lesson. We love to help our students have fun and we expect them to learn many different types of songs, practice weekly, and create good habits in whatever instument they choose. This is also true for our voice students! We recommend a half hour lesson for beginners and a 45 minute or one hour lesson for advanced students.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you have more questions?

Adults often move through beginner material more quickly than our children, therefore your teacher can customize material to better suite your needs.</p><p>We are thrilled if you are an advanced adult student looking to hone in on a specific skill. Our instructors are professionals with the experience to serve you!</p><p>Adult students can expect a partnership with their teacher. We want you to define the objective of your music lessons. The teacher and student can work cooperatively to move toward that goal throughout the year. Some examples of objectives are: being able to read and intepret sheet music, improving vocal quality in an experience singer, improvising with worship music or other chord charts, gaining basic skill in theory, learning to play another instrument, learning a specific genre of music like jazz or classical. Whatever your desired skill is, we can work with you to make it happen!</p><p>We recommend a half hour lesson for beginners and a 45 minute or one hour lesson for advanced students.

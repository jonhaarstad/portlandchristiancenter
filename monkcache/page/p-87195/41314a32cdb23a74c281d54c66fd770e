Not a bad preparation for the workforce!&rdquo;<br><strong>- Gregory Anrig</strong></blockquote><p>Musical training is an important building block to life long skills like: self-discipline, patience, self esteem, coordination, concentration, team work, cultural understanding, and communication.</p><p>Recent studies have provided evidence that music education produces physiological changes in the brain, which enhance children&rsquo;s abstract reasoning skills and improves their abilities in mathematics, science, and engineering. Another study reported that early exposure to music enhances cognitive processes involved in language and reasoning.</p><p>Best of all, music is fun and can be a source of enjoyment for a lifetime! It is never too late to begin or continue learning music. Our adult students enjoy developing their musical skills and/or exploring new musical expressions.</p>

This is why Mpact Girls Clubs are structured to intentionally build meaningful, lifelong relationships with mentors who encourage each girl&rsquo;s healthy spiritual development and guide her in developing her gifts and abilities.</p><h4>Weekly Club Meetings</h4><p>At our weekly Mpact meetings, the girls build a sense of belonging, discipline and commitment as they advance through the stages of the program. They wear uniforms, learn new skills, earn merit badges, and learn to put their Bible lessons into practice. The girls are honored annually for their achievements in a special Award and Recognition Ceremony.</p><h4>Special Events</h4><p>Our Mpact Girls also have many opportunities to participate in exciting special events throughout the year such as:</p><ul><ul><li>Class Outings</li><li>Girls Camp - a large annual event</li><li>Annual Sleepover - a huge sleepover event geared toward making each girl feel special and helping them connect with God and others</li></ul></ul><p>If you questions about Mpact Girls Clubs, contact Pastor Phil at <script type='text/javascript'>var u532204400='phahn'; var h203621561='pcctoday.com';var linktext=u532204400+'@'+h203621561;h203621561='pcctoday.com';document.write('<a href=' + 'mail' + 'to:' + u532204400 + '@' + h203621561 + '>' + linktext + '</a>');

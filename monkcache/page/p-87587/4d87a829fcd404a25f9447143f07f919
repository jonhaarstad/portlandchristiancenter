<blockquote>"Rejoice with those who rejoice [sharing others' joy], and weep with those who weep [sharing others' grief]."&nbsp; <strong>- Romans 12:15</strong></blockquote>
<p>Life offers great joys and challenges. Sometimes those joys are shared with others &ndash; the dedication of a new child, a wedding, or even baptism.&nbsp; Other times life offers challenges, difficulties or loss. Portland Christian Center cares about all area&rsquo;s of your life, and is here to minister to you through our Congregational Life Ministry.</p>

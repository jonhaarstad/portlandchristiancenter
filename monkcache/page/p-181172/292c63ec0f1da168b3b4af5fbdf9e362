<p>Throughout its history, Portland Christian Center has had a tremendous impact throughout the world. However, In 2008 Pastor Ray and Linda began to paint a new and bolder picture of how our church, fully unleashed, could advance God&rsquo;s Kingdom like never before. Over the last 2 years we have reorganized staff, realigned resources and released new ministries. We have set our hearts to fulfill our true calling&mdash;bridging people to Christ&mdash;with greater passion, urgency and effectiveness than ever before!</p>
<p>However, in these leaner economic times, dollars going to debt are hindering our ability to do all we can to advance our calling expeditiously. We have two choices: Pay the bank with interest, or remove our debt and unleash ministry with greater effectiveness. A ripened kingdom harvest awaits us like never before! We believe God is calling us now to unleash and leverage all of our resources so we don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity to proclaim the gospel to a generation of people within our reach.</p>
<p>Now is our time to unleash the church!</p>
<h3>Debt Payoff Schedule</h3>
<p>For every dollar we raise to pay off our debts today, a dollar is unleashed in an exponential way into ministry and mission of our church. We have two choices: pay the bank or unleash ministry.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<!--
<p>We believe Portland Christian Center, fully unleashed, would be the mightiest expression of the church of Jesus Christ the world has ever known&mdash;and that is God&rsquo;s invitation to us.</p>
<p>Today our church stands at the door of a great opportunity but it is not without challenges. In the past, we borrowed money to make our church what it is today, a great place of ministry. We have managed our debt and budget well. But now, in these leaner economic times, dollars going to debt are hindering our ability to advance our mission to that next level.</p>
<p>We are thus prayerfully entering a campaign to refocus our church for greater impact. By unleashing the budget dollars currently devoted to debt we will be able to enrich our departmental ministries and expand outreach to our community and the world. Linda and I will be leading the way in this endeavor with our participation and commitment. Join us and see God multiply our resources for His glory.</p>
<p><strong>Pastor Ray and Linda Noah</strong></p>

<h3>Why have we decided to address our debt now?</h3>
<p>The desire to reduce or pay our debt in full resulted from conversations with our leadership and invested members/attendees. Through various forums, we began to envision what we, the church, might look like if we were to function as the full expression of Christ in our world. We then realized that by paying off the existing debt/mortgage on the church, more funds could be unleashed for greater impact&mdash;for the glory of God. Our decision: pay the bank OR unleash ministry.</p>
<h3>What is a Capital Stewardship Campaign?</h3>
<p>It is an effort to raise funds for a specified purpose that encompasses the spiritual aspect of giving whileachieving certain financial goals.</p>
<h3>How did we arrive at the goal of raising $3 million dollars?</h3>
<p>$3 million includes all of our existing debt plus interest due between the launch of the campaign and final payment at the end of 3 years.</p>
<h3>How much is our debt costing us?</h3>
<p>For the next 3 years we are liable $36,000 a month; thereafter, $30,000 a month for the next 6+ years until our balance is paid in full. Paying our debt early, we will save approximately $1 million dollars in interest and that, plus $36,000 unleashed every month, will go a long way to fund expanded ministry.</p>
<h3>How may I prepare to participate?</h3>
<p>Allow God to speak to you through prayer. Here are some Scripture passages that speak about stewardship and giving: 1 Cor. 16:2, Prov. 11:25, Prov. 3:5-9, 2 Cor. 8:7, Acts 20:35, Luke 6:38, and Psalm 116:12.</p>
<h3>Will I be pressured to make a pledge?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not. Participation in the campaign and how much you give is entirely up to you. We ask you to pray and seek the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<h3>When will we hope to accomplish this goal?</h3>
<p>We hope for all gifts to be received within 3 years. Your commitment can be paid all at once or periodically over the 3-year pledge period.</p>
<h3>When will my pledge be accepted?</h3>
<p>Pledges and contributions can be given anytime up through Commitment Sunday May 22 (and beyond if you need more time).</p>
<h3>If I can&rsquo;t give a large amount, does my pledge really matter?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! All pledges matter, regardless of amount, because as we all participate according to our ability, God multiplies our giving. We hope that all will participate by prayer, encouragement and if possible, giving.</p>
<h3>When are we expected to notify the church of the amount pledged?</h3>
<p>Some contributors select to give immediately. However, pledge cards will be turned in on Commitment Sunday (May 22), and pledges will begin to be received shortly thereafter and continue for up to 3 years. You may update your commitment at any time.</p>
<h3>What forms of contributions will be accepted?</h3>
<p>There are a variety of ways to give: cash, check, credit card or online via our website. Gifts of appreciated property (marketable stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) or qualified charitable distributions from an IRA are also acceptable.</p>

<h2 class="n">Four's Class</h2>
<h3><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>Developed for children who are turning three and one-half by Sept. 1st, (or three by March 1st) our Four&rsquo;s Class is rich in oral language and early literacy development, and is tailored for the slightly older preschooler than our Three&rsquo;s program. This class provides opportunities to develop a longer attention span and focusing skills, while at the same time integrating sensory exploration, self-expression, and purposeful play. We provide a hands-on, exploratory Science program which includes age-appropriate experiments. Our Art program is a combination of project-oriented crafts, and process-oriented self-expression. Numbers and pre-math concepts are presented using the calendar, math manipulatives for sorting and patterning, and rote counting. God is honored in all aspects of our curriculum, and our Bible curriculum is positive and age-appropriate.</p>
<p>Circle time provides a time when everyone gets together to greet one another, accomplish daily routines, read a story, sing, or any other readiness activity as a whole class. During table time, students are divided into smaller groups to do activities and/or projects with a teacher guiding and helping them. Smaller groups give children more individual attention and also a chance to interact with other children. It also teaches the students listening skills, waiting for a turn, and respecting the work of others. Our recess time is held both indoors and outdoors (weather permitting), and gives the students an opportunity to use their bodies, have more freedom to be loud, and to test their bodies and their environment. Sharing food together during our snack time is a pleasant was for children and teachers to socialize. Students are also learning manners and respect, about health and nutrition, how to make conversation, and how to work together.</p>

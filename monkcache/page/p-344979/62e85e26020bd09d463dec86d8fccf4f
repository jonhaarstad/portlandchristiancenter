<h2>Singles Community</h2>
<blockquote><strong>Encounter</strong>&nbsp;is a new and growing singles community for single adults in their 30s and 40s who want to grow in their relationship with Christ and connect with people in a similar season of life. We are intentional about connecting with others, with God, and the community-- and having fun while doing it! We do that through creating environments and events that are engaging and welcoming, like hiking, bowling, discussing practical life topics, and enjoying lunch or coffee. If you are looking for a place to belong, we invite you to join us and encounter authentic community.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://secure.accessacs.com/access/eventlogin.aspx?id=FRUo2yivP+WdcekbDfi+8w==&amp;site=1233&amp;ReturnUrl=events%2fwz_people.aspx&amp;ChurchID=3183&amp;EventID=53417&amp;sn=1233" class="button">Childcare Registration</a></p>
<p>Our goal is to facilitate connections between God and others and to unpack what God has to say about how you can thrive in life. Each week we provide opportunities for you to grow in your relationship with Christ and relate to others in fun and interactive ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's something new each week, but we always start with food and conversation. Some nights we'll have a 30-minute study and challenge from the Word of God, followed by a guided table talk in smaller groups to further explore the topic. &nbsp;Other times we'll hear an amazing story of one of our singles' changed life and be inspired to live with purpose. Some nights we'll play games, watch a movie, or take dinner to the homeless in our community. The goal of this gathering is connection. We grow when we study the Word of God, commit to applying it to our lives, and laugh together. This is the highlight of the week!</p>
<p>Please also join us in&nbsp;<a href="/ministries/adult-education/lifeskills/">LifeSkills Adult Class</a>&nbsp;at 9:00 AM where we have a group table, and then at the 10:45 AM&nbsp;<a href="/about/contact-us/sundays-celebration-services/">Celebration Service</a>&nbsp;in the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>We offer complimentary&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcctoday.com/ministries/children/">childcare for ages birth - 5th grade</a>&nbsp;during both the 9:00 AM &amp; 10:45 AM Celebration Services. We also have Sunday school small groups for&nbsp;<a href="/ministries/middle-school/weekly-gatherings/">middle school</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/get-connected/high-school/connect-with-god/">high school</a>&nbsp;students during first service only. Teens are welcome to attend the 10:45 AM service with their parents or friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sundays, 12:30 PM (after church ends)</h4>
<p>Join our singles family for lunch after church! &nbsp;Once a month, we meet in the Lobby after second service to go out to a reasonably priced restaurant. There is no agenda for Sunday lunches. &nbsp;We want you to come, relax and enjoy the company of others. &nbsp;Feel free to bring kids, friends, or come by yourself.&nbsp;</p>

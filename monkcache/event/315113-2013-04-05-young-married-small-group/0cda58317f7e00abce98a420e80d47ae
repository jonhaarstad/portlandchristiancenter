<h3><strong>"Simple Life"&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<div><span>Like most people today, you are busy; there&rsquo;s no question about that. But the more you think about it, the more you wonder where your life is going. Where is all the busyness taking you?&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>If you feel that your life is out of control, that you are not spending your limited time and money on the things that are most important to you, that circumstances you have allowed to take over your life are hurting your relationships with people and with God, then perhaps you too want to become a revolutionary.</span></div>

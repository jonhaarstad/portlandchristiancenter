A2 Community Groups||<p>A2 is all about sharing life together. It is built around community groups (20-40 people), meeting together in homes from 7-8:30pm on Friday nights to hang out, share some light food, have a brief, Bible-based discussion time, and then hang out some more! You can expect to be greeted at the door and welcomed into a comfortable, lightly-structured time of meeting people, having fun, and listening in or sharing your thoughts on a relevant, Biblical topic.</p>

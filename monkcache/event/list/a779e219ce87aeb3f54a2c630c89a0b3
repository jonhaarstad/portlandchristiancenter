<p>We can't wait to host our next series of Connect classes. This time around we have four classes you can choose from. Each class is taught by one of our teaching pastors at Portland Christian Center. These classes are our spiritual pathway for you to find new ways to invest your time in relationship with Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aren't just here to learn, we are also excited to help you connect with others in order to develop deep, supportive friendsgips that are built on mor than just commonality, they are built on Jesus Christ!</p>
<h3>Here Is What It Looks Like</h3>
<p>Drop off the kids at their class (if you have kids) and head on in to your class for the afternoon. We will have greeters ready to show you where your class is meeting. For the next two hours, enjoy an interactive class with your pastor and with some new friends at your discussion table. At 5:00 PM we break for dinner. Take yourself down to the Trailhead, leave the kids in their classrooms. Find a seat and enjoy a gourmet dinner. Take the next 45 minutes to get to know others around your table. After dinner is done, we will head back into our classes for one more hour. The last hour of class is usually more application and hands-on. Our pastors want you to leave not only knowing what they should do, but with the practical knowledge of having done it yourself. Finally, exchange numbers/emails/facebook profiles and remember to connect with the new friends you have made!</p>

<p><strong>Vision<br /></strong>During town hall meetings hosted by Pastor Ray and Linda Noah, it became increasingly evident that there was a huge need in our church for a ministry for 30 and 40 year old singles. After prayerful consideration, Pastor Rod and Huyen Rider have answered that call. They are both excited and willing to see where God takes them in this new area of ministry.&nbsp;</p></div>

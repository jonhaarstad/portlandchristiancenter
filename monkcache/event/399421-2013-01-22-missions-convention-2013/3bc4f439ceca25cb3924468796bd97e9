The needs of people in Portland, Oregon and around the world call out to us to offer solutions to a broken and mixed up world and to accomplish this task, it will require every person to do their own part. God calls all of us to missions, but not all of us are called to do the same thing. Now is the time to focus your attention and your prayers to God, asking Him &ldquo;Which talents have you given me to invest and where would you have me invest them?&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong> This is how we change the world: each of us making our own contribution of prayers, time, energy, and offerings. We want you to experience the joy of missions.</strong></p><h3><strong>Our Core Principles For Missions</strong></h3><ul class="list_006"><li>All of our local/global outreaches are <strong>BIBLE-BASED.</strong></li><li>The <strong>CHURCH</strong> is the cornerstone of every outreach effort.</li><li>100% of donations for missions go to <strong>MISSIONS</strong>!</li><li>Every project considered for missions resources are <strong>VETTED</strong> through our missions team made up of your peers and church board.</li><li>Our focus is on <strong>REACHING</strong> the <strong>UNREACHED</strong> people groups of the world with the love of Christ.</li><li>We invest in projects that are <strong>SUSTAINABLE</strong> and <strong>REPRODUCIBLE.</strong></li></ul><h3>Missions Convention Schedule</h3><h4>Sunday, January 20th at 9:00 AM &amp; 10:45 AM</h4><p><strong>Adult Services:</strong>&nbsp;A presentation by guest speaker Dr. Howard Foltz will focus on the beauty of spiritual transformation and on the value and importance of a strategic investment in missions through a &ldquo;Faith Promise.&rdquo; What is a &ldquo;Faith Promise?&rdquo;&nbsp; Your invited to come and find out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Children Services:</strong>&nbsp;A presentation by missionaries to children in Africa, letting every child hear and experience stories about children whose lives have been changed by Christ, just like children in America.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.pcctoday.com/monkimage.php?mediaDirectory=mediafiles&amp;mediaId=1887313&amp;fileName=graphic--photo--howard-foltz-0-0-151-183.jpg" width="151" height="183" alt="GRAPHIC : PHOTO : Howard Foltz" title="GRAPHIC : PHOTO : Howard Foltz" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></p><h5><strong>Howard Foltz</strong><br><span class="title">President of AIMS - Accelerating International Mission Strategies</span></h5><p>Dr. Howard Foltz, established AIMS (Accelerating International Mission Strategies) in 1991.

<p>Alpha is open to all people of all ages and backgrounds.&nbsp; If you are open-minded and interested in engaging in conversations regarding your faith then this is a great spot for you.&nbsp; We will look at the basics of the Christian faith and talk about how that relates to our every day lives.</p>

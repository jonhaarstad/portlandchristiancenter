<h3>Weekly Singles Events</h3>
<p><strong>Sundays at 12:30 PM (right after church ends)<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Sundays after church, join our singles family for lunch. Most weeks we meet up in the foyer after second service and go out to a reasonably priced restaurant. There is no agenda for Sunday lunches, we want you to come, relax and enjoy the company of other Christ followers. Feel free to bring kids, friends, or come by yourself. Pastor Rod is usually in <a href="/ministries/adult-education/lifeskills/">LifeSkills Adult Class</a> at 9:00 AM where they have a singles small group table. He welcomes you to join both he and Huyen there, and at the 10:45 AM <a href="/about/contact-us/sundays-celebration-services/">Celebration Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*We offer c<a href="/ministries/children/">omplimentary childcare for ages birth - 5th grade</a>&nbsp;during both the 9:00 AM &amp; 10:45 AM Celebration Services. We also have Sunday school small groups for <a href="/ministries/middle-school/weekly-gatherings/">middle school</a> and <a href="/get-connected/high-school/connect-with-god/">high school</a> students during first service only. Teens are welcome to attend the second service with their parents or with their friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Friday Nights &nbsp;7:00 - 9:00 PM<br /></strong><strong>Childcare is Available if You Register By Tuesday 5:00PM</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We are being intentional on building connections, unpacking what God has to say about you and provide opportunities to discover that out in fun and interactive ways.</p>
<div>
<p>Each week&rsquo;s lay out will vary. There will be opportunity to connect with food and conversation, followed by a challenge from the Word of God. A guided table talk consisting of 6 to 8 people to further explore the topic will follow. This creates the feel of a small group and encourages people towards deeper conversation and connection. To keep things fresh and fun, activities will vary from week to week. We may go downtown and serve the homeless dinner, play games, discuss current topics, or just hang out. Come and be a part of this Singles community!</p>

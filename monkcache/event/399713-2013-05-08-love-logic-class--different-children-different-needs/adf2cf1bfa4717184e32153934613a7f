Learn why two children can behave so differently and still come from the same parents. Practice using the same parenting techniques a little differently depending on your child's love languages. Discover why you and your spouse parent two different ways. You won't find another parenting class in Portland, Oregon quite like this!&nbsp;</p>
<p>A typical class session involves a brief teaching session with our Love &amp; Logic Instructor. Then, we practie skills, answer questions, and discuss in groups. We usually send you with homework to practice and bring back any questions the following week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can expect to see new moms and dads, childcare providers, teachers, moms and dads with several kids, grandparents, caregivers, and many other types of people!</p>
<p>If you are looking for a reasonably priced parenting class in Portland, we welcome you to join us every Wednesday night from April 3 - June 5 at 7:00 PM.&nbsp;</p>

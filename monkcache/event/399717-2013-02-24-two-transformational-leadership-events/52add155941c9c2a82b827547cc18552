<p><em>Friends,</em></p>
<p><em>God is calling us as a Portland church to be ready and to reach out to the lost world like never before: to love the unlovely, serve the poor, declare the Good News to the lost, and lay down our lives so even those who are hostile to us can see our Heavenly Father displayed in us. This will only happen when we have a healthy, fully functioning body. I believe Ford Taylor's teaching on transformational leadership provides us the exact skillset needed to live and lead as Bible-believing Christians in a lost and sometimes hostile world.</em></p>
<p><em>God&rsquo;s hand is on our great church, God&rsquo;s hand is on YOU!&nbsp; If you are a leader or volunteer in our church, please join Linda and me for these special events to be prepared for YOUR calling. We would love it if every leader (teens and adults), and every volunteer joined us for these great training events. I promise it will be life changing!</em></p>
<p><em>-- Pastor Ray and Linda&nbsp;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Put on all of God's armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies and tricks of the Devil.&nbsp; For we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against those mighty powers of darkness who rule this world, and against wicked spirits in the heavenly realms.&rdquo; <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>--Ephesians 6:11-12 (NLT)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word teaches that we are in a war that rages all around us.&nbsp; It is invisible, it is spiritual, and it is real.&nbsp; As believers, if we are not aware of the war and prepared for it, we will live weakened, if not defeated lives, spiritually, emotionally, relationally, financially and even physically.</p>
<p>In this 8 week Spiritual Warfare Series, you will learn that you don&rsquo;t have to be defeated&mdash;not even intimidated&mdash;by your enemy.&nbsp; You were made to prevail in this conflict, but you must learn how to fight right.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what the Apostle Paul teaches in Ephesians 6. &nbsp;God has designed and destined you to push back the powers of darkness and destroy Satan&rsquo;s work in your life and in your world.&nbsp; You have been given God&rsquo;s armor to defend against the attack and spiritual weapons to go on the offensive to win the battle.</p>
<p>Join us each Sunday and learn how to take your stand and prevail in the battle.</p>

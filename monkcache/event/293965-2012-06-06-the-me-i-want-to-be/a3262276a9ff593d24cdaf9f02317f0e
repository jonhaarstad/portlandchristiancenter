The Me I Want To Be||<h2><span style="font-size: 20px;">Becoming God's Very Best Version of You</span></h2>
<p><i>SUNDAY, April 11 - June 24, 9:00 a.m. in the gymnasium in our LifeSkills<br />WEDNESDAY, April 15 - June 13, 7:00 p.m. in the Hospitality Center</i></p>
<p><b>I am not the me I want to be. You are not either. We both desire to become better people. But what does better mean? And how do we become better?</b></p>
<p>This series is designed to help you answer these two questions through dynamic speaking, small group discussion, and plenty of take-home material for those looking to go even deeper. Through this series you will be discussing how each person is designed as a wholly spiritual being. You were not made to have a compartmentalized spiritual life, family life, work life, romantic life, super-hero life...&nbsp;<br />YOU WERE MADE TO BE A COMPLETE WHOLE PERSON.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Here are a few major topics we will be discussing</h4>
<ul>
<li>finding my identity</li>
<li>flowing with the spirit</li>
<li>renewing my mind</li>
<li>redeeming my time</li>
<li>deepening my relationships</li>
<li>trasformino my experience</li>
<li>flowing from here on out</li>
</ul>

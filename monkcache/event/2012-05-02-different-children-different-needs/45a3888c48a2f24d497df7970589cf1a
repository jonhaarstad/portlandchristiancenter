Different Children, Different Needs||<p>Here at Portland Christian Center we offer a wide range of parenting classes each trimester. Currently, our Love &amp; Logic Teacher, Amy Slater is working through Different Children, Different Needs. This class combines an personality assessment of you, your spouse, and your children to better help you parent. This class is also recommended for teachers and other highly relational jobs.&nbsp;</p>

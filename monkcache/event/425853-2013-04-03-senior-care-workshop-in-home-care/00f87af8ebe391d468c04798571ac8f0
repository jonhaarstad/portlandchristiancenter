Taking the opportunity to learn about services before you need them can put you miles ahead when it&rsquo;s time to make informed decisions. In-home care is not the answer for everyone, but it can add years of satisfying, independent living to an aging person&rsquo;s life. Join us for a good discussion with take-home materials and time for questions.</p>

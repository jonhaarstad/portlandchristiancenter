<h4><a href="/life-learning/spiritual-life-classes/study-in-the-book-of-ephesians/">STUDY IN THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</a></h4>
<p><strong><em>7:00-8:30 PM in the Chapel</em></strong><br />How does God think about you?&nbsp;What does Jesus want you to do with your life? How can you overcome negative influences each day? If you want to understand your identity in Christ, there&rsquo;s no better place to start than the book of Ephesians&mdash;a letter written by Paul to a group of people who had these same questions. Rev. Rod and Huyen Rider pulls from biblical, historical, and scholarly sources to bring us surprising insights from the book of Ephesians.</p>

<p><strong><em>7:00-8:30 PM in Room 228</em></strong><br /> <em>The Coming Economic Armageddon: What Bible Prophecy Warns about the New Global Economy&nbsp;</em>by David Jeremiah. Never before have we read such jarring headlines, distressing news analyses, or dire predictions concerning the world's financial future. The American housing market - or, more sentimentally, the American dream - began to collapse in 2006, taking with it large chunks of the global financial system. Millions of jobs worldwide have vanished forever. Did Bible prophecy predict this catastrophe? Are there biblical clues to how soon, if ever, a viable, long-term recovery can be sustained? Is the financial collapse just one of several signs that we are living in the final days of Earth's history in The Coming Economic Armageddon, David Jeremiah says we can know the meaning behind what we see in the daily news - and understand and prepare for living in the New Global Economy.</p>

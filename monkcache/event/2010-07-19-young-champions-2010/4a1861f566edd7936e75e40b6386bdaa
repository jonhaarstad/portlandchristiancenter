<p>Over ten years ago, Portland Christian Center organized the first Young Champions. Our goal was to provide a fun and safe environment where kids can improve their athletic skills, learn about good sportsmanship and develop character. We believe that sports should be fun! We foster an an environment of play and learning, where kids will discover that participating in sports is one of the keys to an active and healthy life.</p>

<h4>September 1, 12:00 - 4:00 PM</h4>
<p>Bring your family and neighbors and join hundreds of Portland Christian Center attenders for our 2013 Annual All-Church Picnic. This year, we return to the nearby Gabriel Park, within five minutes from the church. For those with handicap parking needs, we will even have shuttles available to take you to the park and back.</p>
<p>We will be serving one of the finest summertime meals in town, and all for a reasonable price.&nbsp;Not only will we have great food, but there will be lots of activities for everyone. This will be a hit for the youth, children, and parents.&nbsp;For those who wish to hang around in the shade and relax, we have a select location available throughout the afternoon. You can eat, play and chat to your hearts content.<b><br /></b></p>

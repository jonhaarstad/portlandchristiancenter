Love &amp; Logic Class : Different Children, Different Needs||<p>We are always excited for a new round of Love &amp; Logic classes, and our current topic focusing on how different our kids are from each other and us, is especially helpful for ... well, EVERYONE! Learn why two children can behave so differently and still come from the same parents. Practice using the same parenting techniques a little differently depending on your child's love languages. Discover why you and your spouse parent two different ways. You won't find another parenting class in Portland, Oregon quite like this!&nbsp;</p>
<p>A typical class session involves a brief teaching session with our Love &amp; Logic Instructor. Then, we practie skills, answer questions, and discuss in groups. We usually send you with homework to practice and bring back any questions the following week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can expect to see new moms and dads, childcare providers, teachers, moms and dads with several kids, grandparents, caregivers, and many other types of people!</p>
<p>If you are looking for a reasonably priced parenting class in Portland, we welcome you to join us every Wednesday night from April 3 - June 5 at 7:00 PM.&nbsp;</p>

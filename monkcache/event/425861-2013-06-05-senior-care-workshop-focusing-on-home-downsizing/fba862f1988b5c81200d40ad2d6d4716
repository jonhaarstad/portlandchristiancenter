<p><strong>Take Care Move Assistance</strong>&nbsp;Are you, or a loved one, considering moving to a retirement community or a smaller home? Are you looking around your home and thinking, &ldquo;How will I ever get out of here? I have so much stuff and so many decisions!&rdquo; Understandably, it can seem overwhelming to consider downsizing a lifetime of treasures and memories. Truth is, downsizing and making the move to retirement living really can be a positive experience. With some careful planning, trusted resources, and a clear vision of your goals, downsizing can be easier than you would think. In this Workshop you will learn some great tips as well as ideas of how to take the stress out of what, to many, may seem the biggest obstacle when considering and planning a move to a smaller setting.</p>
<p><strong>Millius Estate Services</strong>The time has come for you to move to a smaller location, whether it&rsquo;s to a retirement apartment or smaller house. What you&rsquo;ve found out is that you have too many personal belongings that just won&rsquo;t fit in to the new location. If you are relocating or helping someone else relocate or liquidate an estate, you may benefit from professional sale management services, which will be discussed in this part of the Workshop. Some of these services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salable items are evaluated, researched and priced; appraisals are done as needed</li>
<li>Sale is advertised in various media</li>
<li>Staff is hired to assist with set up and security at the sale location</li>
<li>Disposition of unsold items is taken care of</li>
<li>Timely financial report is provided to the client</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sundays at 9:00 AM in the Youth Center</strong></p>
<p>Sunday morning is your time to connect with other students in a discussion setting. Our small group leaders and students would enjoy having you join thier group. The small groups work through a few thought provoking questions and take time to pray for one another and catch up on what is happening in each others' lives. This is a great way to get to know students in your age group.</p>
<p>*College Students are welcome too! (Ages 18-23)</p></div>

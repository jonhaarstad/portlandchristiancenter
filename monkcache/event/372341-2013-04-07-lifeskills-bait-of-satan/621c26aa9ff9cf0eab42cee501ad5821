LifeSkills: Bait of Satan||<p><strong><em>Join the LifeSkills Community as we begin this series that will transform the way you react to offense!</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Bait of Satan</em><span>&nbsp;exposes one of the most deceptive snares Satan uses to get believers out of the will of God-offense. Most people who are ensnared by the bait of Satan don't even realize it. Don't be fooled! You will encounter offense, and it's up to you how it will affect your relationship with God. Your response will determine your future. If offense is handled correctly, you will become stronger rather than bitter.</span></p>

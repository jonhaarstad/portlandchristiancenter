<p><b><em><strong>7:00-8:30 PM in the Hospitality Center</strong><br /></em></b><em>Interruptions.</em>They're aggravating.  Sometimes infuriating. But how we handle interruptions actually tell us more about  ourselves. <em>Jonah: Navigating a Life Interrupted</em> provides a personal  study experience five days a week in this in-depth women's Bible study.  In 7 sessions, Priscilla redefines interruption and shows that  interruption is actually God's invitation to do something beyond our  wildest dreams. When Jonah was willing to allow God to interrupt his  life, the result was revival in an entire city. Led by Ingrid Roland</p>

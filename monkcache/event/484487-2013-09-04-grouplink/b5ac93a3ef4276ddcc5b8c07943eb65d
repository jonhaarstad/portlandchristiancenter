<h3>GroupLink -&nbsp;Connect and Grow</h3>
<p>Are you curious about classes at Portland Christian Center or would you like to investigate a community group? Then, come to GroupLink! GroupLink is a Wednesday evening event where you can meet people in a similar stage of life, with similar interests, and with the goal of connecting and growing by forming a community group or participating in a class. A host and plenty of staff members and volunteers will be on hand to navigate you through the process of meeting others and connecting for growth. GroupLink is a great way to get connected!</p>

Unleashed Noon Prayer Hour||<p>Please join with the entire congregation in prayer for "Unleashed", repurposing our resources...releasing our potential!  Set aside the Noon hour on May 3, 10 &amp; 17 to pray for our church, our city and our world. Pray on your own, at your home or workplace, or join others in the PCC Chapel as we lift up our Church in prayer!</p>

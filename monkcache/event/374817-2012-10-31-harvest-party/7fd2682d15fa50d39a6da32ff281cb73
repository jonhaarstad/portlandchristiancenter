Harvest Party||<h3>Announcing the Harvest Party!</h3>
<h4>Wednesday October 31 at 6:30pm &ndash; 8:30pm</h4>
<p><strong>Adventure Kids</strong> at Portland Christian Center presents our <strong>2012 Harvest Party</strong> for kids. Parents are welcome too! There will be games, candy, costume contest, and a short puppet and magic show. There will also be a drawing for a <strong>FREE BIKE!</strong> Admission is free. Kids birth &ndash; 5th grade are welcome, 5 and younger require and adult.</p>
<blockquote>We would love to see you and your kids decked out in <strong>full costume</strong>! We will have a contest for the best costume of the night. Get creative and have fun with it. How many nights of the year do you get to dress up like a gorilla or a superhero?</blockquote>
<h4>Have Some Time or Candy to Spare?</h4>
<p>You can help in any of these three ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite and bring your friends and neighbors.</li>
<li>Donate pre-packaged candy into the box in the foyer.</li>
<li>Sign up at the info desk to help with the games and activities that night.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Here is What You Can Expect:</h3>
<p>As families enter the gym they will register for a drawing for a <strong> NEW BIKE</strong> and get a candy bag. The gym will be decked out with an inflatable bounce house, an inflatable obstacle course, and the rest of the room will be filled with carnival-style games such as ring toss, knock down the target, and bowling. These games will all give out candy. <strong>Yummm...</strong>At the end of the night, we will shut down the games and food for a short, ten-minute gospel presentation with a puppet and a magic trick. The prize drawing will be after the gospel presentation and families must be present to win.</p>
<h4>What if my child is under the age of 5?</h4>
<p>We request that you remain with your child for their safety. There will be a small area roped off in the corner with a few extra games that will only be for preschoolers so parents with smaller kids have an extra option for more age appropriate games without competing with elementary kids.</p>
<h4>Don't Forget About Dinner and Snacks!</h4>
<p>We will have foods like hot dogs, nachos, and popcorn for sale for hungry kids and parents. You can grab a dog, and sit in the Trailhead Room for a quick bite anytime between 5:00 - 8:30 PM.</p>

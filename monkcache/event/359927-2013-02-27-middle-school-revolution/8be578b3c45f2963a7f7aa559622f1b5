<p>Revolution is a safe place to meet new friends and have lots of fun together. We shatter the &ldquo;church is boring&rdquo; stereotype and give you tons of reasons to get connected and grow in Jesus! The best part is that we engage you and challenge you to become the person who God has created you to be.&nbsp;</p></div>

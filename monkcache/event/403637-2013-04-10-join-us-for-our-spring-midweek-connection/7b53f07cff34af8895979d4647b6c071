Join us for our Spring Midweek Connection!||<blockquote>Every Wednesday night, Portland Christian Center offers evening classes and age specific groups for you to connect with others and grow in your relationship with God! We have diverse classes for adults, including our main gathering called "<a href="/midweek-gathering/">Messy Church</a>" featuring 1 Corinthians with Pastor Joel. We also offer a parenting class, financial class, three topic driven Bible studies, a small group study with lead Pastor Ray Noah, and special workshops. If you have a child or teenager in your home, we would love to introduce them to our <a href="/ministries/children/">children's programs</a> beginning at 6 &amp; 7PM as well as our <a href="/revolution/">middle school</a> and <a href="/unveiled/">high school</a> youth groups. For a full schedule, just scroll down our list below. You won't find a better community church in Portland, Oregon to grow in on a Wednesday night!</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>God will guide us and accompany us, but we have to take that first step into blessing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come get away for a night and connect with old friends and new, reflect, learn, laugh, and experience some fun surprises as our speaker Amanda Higgins takes us on a journey through scripture.</p>
